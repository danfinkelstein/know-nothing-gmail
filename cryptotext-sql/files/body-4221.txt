I wouldn't say that it is analogous to the page table. Physical frames are allocated on demand in order up to the amount of physical memory available in the system. So there is some mixing of stack and heap pages, but the binary is loaded in such a way that there is a contiguous block of physical memory for it.

Thanks for the reply Gabe. Is this true for M5 v2.0b3? (no TLB)

        In our repository the TLB is used in both FS and SE mode, and again we
hope to make that publicly available soon. In the version you have the
TLB is not used in SE mode. Instead, a structure analogous to the page
table is used to look up virtual to physical mappings and provides a
similar effect.

Hi all,
    I am running the splash2 benchmarks in SE mode in M5. I want to
capture the DRAM access patterns. I wanted to know if the physic_address
used in the dram.cc is actually the physical address, (as would be
translated by the TLB in the FS mode), or is it some trivial conversion
from the virtual address? Is the TLB used at all in the SE mode?
Thanks,
