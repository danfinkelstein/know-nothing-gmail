The funny thing is that even though I rightly pointed that out, I
still was confusing the callpal rduniq and the MTPR/MFPR.  Seems that
we could have MTPR be serializing and MFPR not be, though we may in
fact need some mechanism to determine which if any of the MFPRs have
side effects.  From a quick glance of readIPR, it seems that none do.
That said, there's a panic in there on some write only registers and
we probably need to turn that into an opdec fault somehow so
misspeculative accesses don't crash the simulator.

I wonder why the callpal itself needs to be non-speculative.  Does it
have to do with switching modes?  The mode is in the PC, so it would
seem to me to be renamed already.
