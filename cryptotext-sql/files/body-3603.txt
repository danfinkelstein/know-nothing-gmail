If you're not interested in keeping the timing realistic, you could
just iterate over all the blocks and set the valid bit to 0, making
sure to write the dirty ones back to memory with functional writes.
The blocks themselves are in the tags classes, e.g., tags/lru.{cc,hh},
so you'd probably want to put the function there (and call it from
Cache<TagStore> in cache.hh/cache_impl.hh).
If you want to be more realistic with timing, then it's trickier, as
you'd have to issue timing writebacks, and be able to stall and
reschedule when the writeback buffer gets full, etc... I'll just hope
that's not what you want.
There's no code to do this currently though, you'll have to write it yourself.
