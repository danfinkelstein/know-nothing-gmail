How do you know ls or no command is running? Have you tried using the trace flags to see if the detailed CPU is executing instructions? What if you create a checkpoint before booting finishes? When you restore from the checkpoint and switch to the detailed CPU does the system finish booting?
If you run with a smaller switch time (say 2000 ticks) does that change anything?
The only other thing I could guess is that you need to put a drain/resume around the switching... Try something like this:

The problem with checkpointing detailed cpu is still
there.
What i am doing is following:
a) Run M5 b3 with atomic simple cpu.
b) take checkpoint after booting finishes.
c) Then trying to restore that checkpoint with
detailed cpu by this command:
./build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt configs/example/fs.py -d
--caches --l2cache -s -w 200000000000 -r 1
It gets to the command prompt in console. But, ls does
not run at all. For that matter no other command is
running.
But if i dont use checkpoint and boot detailed cpu
from scratch, after booting commands seem to work.

The detailed CPU is significantly slower than the
AtomicCPU, so ls
will probably eventually be run, but it's will take
a while. Normally
we checkpoint a certain amount of time after the
checkpoint
instruction after whatever benchmark of interest is
running.
We use the following command line to restore from
the checkpoint and
switch to a detailed CPU. I don't know exactly what
you're running so
I can't be sure if there is a problem or not.
./build/ALPHA_FS/m5.fast configs/example/fs.py -t
--caches --l2cache -
s -w 200000000000 -r 1 --checkpoint_dir=....
Where -s stands for standard switching (to a
detailed cpu), and -w
says warmup the caches/tlb/etc for  200000000000
ticks with a simple
cpu before switching.

Hi,
I am trying to create and restore checkpoints for
detailed CPU model in M5 v2.0b3.
But it is not restoring properly.
While taking checkpoint i am using AtomicSimpleCPU
and
then using "m5 checkpoint" from command line after
booting finishes.
Next while restoring, i am giving the checkpoint
with
--detailed switch.
It switches to timing mode and console goes to
command
prompt. But after that it doesn´t respond to any
command. For example if i restore from checkpoint
in
this way, in the console even "ls" is not
responding.
Am i doing it correctly?
