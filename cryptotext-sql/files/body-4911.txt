I'm trying to build a image for ALPHA_FS on M5.  I've build a kernel
that boots up fine with the image provided on the M5 website.  When I
build my own image the kernel seems to boot, but then at the end I get this:
...
Initializing IPsec netlink socket
NET: Registered protocol family 1
NET: Registered protocol family 17
NET: Registered protocol family 15
Bridge firewalling registered
802.1Q VLAN Support v1.8 Ben Greear <greearb@candelatech.com>
All bugs added by David S. Miller <davem@redhat.com>
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 160k freed
Warning: unable to open an initial console.
Then the system hangs with no shell.  Now, the only deviation from the
instructions on the website to build the image was that I had to
disabled NFS because 'nfs-utils-1.0.6-ptx4.tar.gz' could not be
downloaded.  When I googled for the file, the only place that I could
find had it at one point, but no longer.  I'm assuming the lack of NFS
is causing the problem.  Does anyone have a copy?
Thanks,
~Paul
