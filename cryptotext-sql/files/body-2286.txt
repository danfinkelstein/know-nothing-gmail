I just noticed your failure is happening before the simulation even starts, but
my question is still relevant. Why is your configuration using up 16 GB of
memory before the simulation even gets going? I would be extremely surprised if
your binary was that big, and there shouldn't be much of anything else in memory
when you're starting up. You'd probably do well to figure that out since you may
never be able to give it enough memory otherwise.
