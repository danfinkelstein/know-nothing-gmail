To: stever@eecs.umich.eduCc: "Tor M. Aamodt" <aamodt@ece.ubc.ca>
Hi Steve,I'm having some trouble getting a few SPEC 2000 alpha binaries to compile and run in system emulation mode on your M5 simulator (m5-2.0b3).   I've searched around and found the following documentation which talks a bit about building alpha tools to get alpha binaries:

gcc-4.1 system (which is what we happen to have here).  Seems that it is always hard to build older versions of gcc with newer versions...(b) RE: "however we have lately had some success with 
gcc-4.0.2 coupled with glibc-2.3.6."  -- In contrast, I've successfully built gcc-4.0.2 coupled with glibc-2.3.6 (using crosstool-0.43), but the following SPEC INT 2000 benchmarks are having problems (with the test inputs):

I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong somewhere, or whether you folks have seen problems with these same benchmarks under gcc-4.0.2 coupled with glibc-2.3.6.  Any insight?
Thanks,Tor
