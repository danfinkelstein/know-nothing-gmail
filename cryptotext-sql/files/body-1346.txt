As far as I know no one has ever run a JVM on M5, someone correct me if I'm wrong.I looked into it a while ago - since we really only have ALPHA as the totally mature FS, you'd need a JVM for Alpha, which there used to be one that was under development but seeing as I can't find it on the web anymore I think it might be a dead project.
It would be much simpler to find a JVM for Sparc, but I'm not up on how much is going on with SPARC_FS right now.  Lisa

Hi,
 
I want to use M5 for some Java programs
simulation. I was wondering if there is a support of JVM on M5 FS? Does anyone
have an information on how I can execute Java programs on FS mode?
 
Thanks
Panayiotis
