        I am seeing this message in some of my simulations. Other workloads
on the same configuration finish correctly, and the same workload on
other configurations finishes fine. From my reading of the code, the
error should only occur if an instruction object was corrupted, since
otherwise they would always be correctly built for the specific ISA,
yes?
        Does anyone have any other ideas for how to determine the error?
