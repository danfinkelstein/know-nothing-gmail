My cpu_models.py file got the snippet.By the way, one "deviation" I did with regards to the steps in http://m5.eecs.umich.edu/wiki/index.php/Defining_CPU_Models
 was in the stepm5/src/python/objects/MyCPU.py: Create a python file (e.g. MyCPU.py) so that your CPU can be recognized as a simulation object. For this example, we will just use the same code in the SimpleCPU.py
 file but replace the name 'AtomicSimpleCPU' with 'MyCPU'.I created a MyCPU.py, but I placed it in m5/src/python/m5/objects, since all the other Python object files are in there(03CPU.py,, OzoneCPU.py
, etc). There is not even a directory names "objects" under m5/src/python, the folders under it are m5 and swig. At first I thought this was just an oversight on the part of the tutorial writers, but could this be the culprit?
Here are the linesmycpu_exec.cc 5693    Ra = xc->readIntRegOperand(this, 0);mycpu_exec.cc 5701            xc->setIntRegOperand(this, 0, final_val);Actually the errors I included in my initial email was just a snippet of the very long list of errors(all concerning the invalid use of undefined type 'struct MyCPU').
For the sake of completion, line 64 in static_inst.hh isclass MyCPU;Again, thanks!- Show quoted text -On Dec 27, 2007 3:39 PM, Korey Sewell <ksewell@umich.edu

Does that file include this snippet?:"CpuModel('MyCPU', 'mycpu_exec.cc', '#include "cpu/mycpu/mycpu.hh"', { 'CPU_exec_context': 'MyCPU' })"
Also, what's the actual source code line in mycpu_exec.cc 5693 and 5701?On Dec 26, 2007 11:21 PM, jockie lee <jockie.lee@gmail.com
