Has anyone encountered build problems with gcc 4.1 such as the following?
g++ -pipe -fno-strict-aliasing -Wall -Wno-sign-compare -Werror -Wundef -g
-O5 -m32 -fPIC -Iext/dnet -IALPHA -Im5 -c -o ALPHA/arch/alpha/decoder.os
ALPHA/arch/alpha/decoder.cc
cc1plus: warnings being treated as errors
m5/arch/alpha/isa_traits.hh:296: warning: overflow in implicit constant
conversion
ALPHA/arch/alpha/decoder.cc:5619: error: definition of
'StaticInstPtr<AlphaISA> AlphaISA::decodeInst(uint32_t)' is not in namespace
enclosing 'AlphaISA'
I'm still using M5 1.1 -- is this a problem that's already been fixed in M5 2.0? If so, is the solution something I can apply to 1.1 myself?
Thanks,
Steve Lieberman
