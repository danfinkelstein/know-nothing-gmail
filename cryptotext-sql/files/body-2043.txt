Because you probably switched from one cpu type to another in your
simulation. If you started with an atomic CPU and immediately
transitioned to a timing CPU, the atomic CPU probably only executed 2
instructions

They are different CPUs (in this case before and after the switch
respectively)

The number of committed loads that were executed (this doesn't include
issued and subsequently squashed loads because of miss speculation).
