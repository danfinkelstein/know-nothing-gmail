M5 currently has the ability to simulate multi-core by instantiating
CPU models of your choice in one system.
However, The closest you'll get to a in-order publicly available for
M5 is the SimpleCPU model which is a 1 CPI per machine that models the
memory latency as well.
Implementing an in-order model can be done by adjusting the O3CPU
Out-of-Order parameters to represent a in-order machine (i.e. LDSTQ=1,
ALUs=1, ROB size = size of pipeline, pipeline width = 1) OR
implementing your own model for in-order.
The O3CPU way would probably give you a good approximate of a in-order
machine but depending on your needs it might not be what you want.
There have been a few people that have started an in-order model (or
have/had some version of it working) for M5 (Stephen Hines(?) &
myself) but nothing has been put back in the tree as of yet.
It's simply a matter of time before I can re-direct my time to
integrating the in-order stuff back in the tree but I wouldnt wait on
me for something you need.
If you're interested in implementing a In-Order model from scratch the
best way is probably to base it off of the O3CPU model.
If you have any questions in doing that or need help, I'm sure the M5
community would be more than happy to assist you on your way...
