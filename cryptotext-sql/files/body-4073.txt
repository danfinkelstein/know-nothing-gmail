You're actually telling M5 to run an experiment with the -b option.  I'm not sure how long it takes, but 50 minutes isn't unreasonable.  It also certainly depends on the performance of your machine.  The boot process itself should only take a couple of minutes.  You can look at the console.xxx files in the output directory to see progress.- Show quoted text -
Hello all,
Here is the command line:
sudo ./build/alpha_fs/m5.opt ./configs/example/fs.py
-b NetperfMaerts
The output shows:
....
warn: Entering event queue @ 0. Starting simulation...
The status has been remaining for more than 50 minutes.
Is something wrong with the simulation? Normally how much
time for the simulator boot?
Xin
