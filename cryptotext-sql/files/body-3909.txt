Hi,
   I have some questions about adding a new SDRAM model with out-of-order
memory access scheduling into FS mode. This SDRAM model can run
correctly in SE mode.
    In SE mode, once a memory access is scheduled, the response time will
be sent out by calling the callback function -
slaveInterface->respond().
    In FS mode, there is no such callback function. Instead,
sendTiming(pkt, latency) is called to send the latency to EventQueue.
This function is called every packet and the calculated memory access
latency is fixed.
    My questions are :
    1. Should I derive my SDRAM class from physicalMemory? In SE mode,
this SDRAM model is derived from SimObject class.
    2. In our SDRAM model, memory accesses are scheduled every memory
cycle, could I just call sendTiming(pkt, latency) in my code once the
latency is obtained?
    3. How to set the port to my SDRAM model?
Thanks,
Tracy
