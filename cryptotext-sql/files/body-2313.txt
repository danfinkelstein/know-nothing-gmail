Hi all
I am trying to understand the output that M5 produces. I am running my
program with m5 (v2.05) in x86 Syscall emulation mode.
At the end of the simulation M5 writes a line that says that 'Target
exited at cycle xyz since it called exit()'. The value xyz reported
corresponds to the sim_ticks value in m5stats.txt. What I noticed is a
1-1 correlation between CPU frequency / CPU width and the sim_ticks
value.
What I mean is this: For a fixed workload, if I double the frequency
or width values, the sim_ticks value reported at the end of the
simulation is reduced by half.
Which stat should I be using it as a measure of performance?
Is there a page on the m5 wiki that gives details on the output stats
and the way to interpret it? I wasn't able to locate any.
