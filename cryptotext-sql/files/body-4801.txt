I've been trying really hard to work with checkpoints, without much success... :(I tried SimpleCPU, booting Linux, saving a checkpoint with "m5 checkpoint" inside console of booted Linux, and wanted to restore to that checkpoint later on, in order not to have to wait for booting Linux every time I change something.
I haven't found any documentation about how to do that...I'm using version 1.1 of M5.Can somebody help me with this, please...It's quite urgent, as always things always are :)
