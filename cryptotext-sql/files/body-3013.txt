Where would you expect to see the destructor called?
Presumably if we have examples like
LRU *tags = new LRU(numSets, block_size, assoc, latency);
in src/mem/cache/cache_builder.cc somewhere tags should be deallocated
with delete. If not this may be a memory leak but I would guess not
critical since it should be done on the way towards program
termination. Unless you are doing a design where hardware is
dynamically added and removed...
