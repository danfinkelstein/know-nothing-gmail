Hi,
I am trying to use the M5 simulator with the SPARC_FS to do OS-arch
research.  I have managed to build and boot SPARC_FS with the
OpenSolaris / OpenSparc binaries and images.  Now I have also managed
to boot a custom OS.  However, I cannot get my OS's clock driver to
work, whenever I try to use the tick compare register feature of the
SPARC_FS cpu, I get a panic:
  panic: writing to TICK compare register 0XABFDB48
   @ cycle 90147862000
  [setFSReg:build/SPARC_FS/arch/sparc/ua2005.cc, line 116]
  Memory Usage: 399712 KBytes
  For more information see: http://www.m5sim.org/panic/10ab535e
  Program aborted at cycle 90147862000
  Aborted
I checked out the source code referenced, and sure enough there is a
panic statement that appears like it will always be triggered  by
using this register.  Is there a reason for this panic?  Or is the
panic a typo and it should actually be a printf, like the next case
(for MISCREG_STICK_CMPR)?
