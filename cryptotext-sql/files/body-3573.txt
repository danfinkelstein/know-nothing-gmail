The kernel i am using is actually patched. All patched worked correctly without giving any error on 2.6.18.8 source tree. But still bootup is very very slow.Actually, if you already have a more recent version of kernel working perfectly with beta 4 version why not have that one in standard download?For people who are doing any thing with multiple cores, pinning thread to a processor is a very useful feature to have.----- Mensaje original ----De: nathan binkert <nate@binkert.org>Para: M5 users mailing list <m5-users@m5sim.org>Enviado: miércoles, 6 de febrero, 2008 19:48:12Asunto: Re:

It

Do 
you 
also 
see 
this 
slow 
boot-up?Let 
me 
check 
to 
see 
if 
there 
is 
a 
missing 
patch 
to 
2.6.18.  
There 
arecertain 
functions 
(mostly 
delay 
functions 
and 
the 
idle 
loop) 
in

kernel 
that 
are 
very

Just 
for 
curiosity, 
what 
does

is 
a

thing.  
It's 
a
