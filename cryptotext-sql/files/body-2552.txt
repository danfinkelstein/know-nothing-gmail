there are two step to achieve the goal:
 
1.put your trace flag as you want , you can imitate what he has done in m5; 
2.then you should add the flag you 've defined into the SConstruct file of the package to let compiler know your flag...
 
then when you can get some information when you  tracing. 
 
i havn't read the code for days, hope my poor description can help...or... you can still ask other guys in group...

This has changed recently... the valid trace flags are defined by adding a line like:TraceFlag('Foo')to a SConscript file, typically the one in the same directory where you're using that flag.

hi all
i've  traced some information of memory access when running m5 by se.py...,i 've add something new into m5 and wanted to trace some information about accessing it, after doing that, i got the error "XXX is not the member of TRACE",  i guess there is a list to maintain all kinds of trace options like 'MemoryAccess, Cache, Bus...' , but i failed to get it... so how can i do that if i want to trace some information what i interested in, but not included in m5 currently...plz show me a light? thank u.
