Did you get anywhere with this?  You should really look at the
mercurial documentation.  The choice depends on the usage.  If you're
planning on making massive changes across the board and don't plan to
integrate them, then hg itself probably makes sense.  If you want to
fold your changes back into the tree eventually as patches, or you
have smallish changes that you'd like to benefit from our
improvements, mq probably makes the most sense.
If you're creating completely new models, then using EXTRAS with stuff
in your own repository is probably the way to go.
We'd encourage people to try to fold stuff back into M5 as we do, so
we lean towards mq which is probably the best way to go for that.  I
have HP stuff that is private to HP that I do with a separate
repository and the EXTRAS thing.
