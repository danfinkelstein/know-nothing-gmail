Hi all,
I am just starting using m5 and I have downloaded the v2 beta3 sources from the site. I have successfully compiled and run the tests for ALPHA_SE, but I have some compilation errors when trying to compile the FS version. Namely the compiler is complaining about not finding the files "encumbered/cpu/full/op_class.hh" and "mem/functional/functional.hh". In fact there is no "mem/functional" folder in the source files at all.
I am attaching a file with all the compiler errors I am given.
Any ideas?
Thanks in advance,
Nikolas
