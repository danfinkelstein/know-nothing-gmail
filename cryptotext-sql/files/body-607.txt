We'd need a lot more information to be able to tell what the actual
problem is. We (to my knowledge) haven't seen this happen. What
benchmarks? What ISA? What mode? Did you make any changes to M5? Do you
know if M5 itself is stuck, or if it's the simulated code? What is the
simulated code doing if/when it's stuck? Does the output look ok
otherwise? Do the statistics, if any, look strange in any way, for
instance a huge number of, say, cache misses, and only a modest number
of completed instructions?

    If you haven't made any changes to M5, you'll just need to download
the new version using mercurial. If you're copy is managed by mercurial,
you could try pulling in the changes from the development repository. I
would suggest backing up your tree first just in case something goes
wrong or the merge is too complicated. If you're not using mercurial,
you could create a patch and apply it to an updated repository.

I don't know of any reason you'd need to, but there might be something
I'm not thinking of.
