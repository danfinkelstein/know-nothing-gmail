Dear All,
Today I accidentally saw something called gem5 in the M5 repository with the
description 'M5 source code -- gems & M5 integration'. If anybody can give me a
brief explanation n current status of that it would be grateful. Hope M5
administrators  will bear me being impatient and I apologies if I am abusing the
purpose of the mailing list.
regards,
Isuru
