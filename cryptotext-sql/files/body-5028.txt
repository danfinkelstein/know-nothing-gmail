I am trying to use the m5.switchCpus function to quickly simulate pass the linux booting stage, and then switch to detailed mode after the full system is booted.  I followed the wiki page and have made minor modifications to the 
fs.py example script including:cpu = AtomicSimpleCPU()cpu2 = DetailedO3CPU()mem_mode = 'timing'...switch_cpu_list = [(cpu,cpu2)]m5.simulate(3663496423522) m5.switchCpus(switch_cpu_list)
exit_event = m5.simulate(maxtick)Most other options I've left the same from the fs.py script, but when I run the simulator, it works perfectly until the switch point and then dies with:Switching CPUs
Traceback (most recent call last):  File "<string>", line 1, in ?  File "build/ALPHA_FS/python/m5/main.py", line 314, in main    execfile(sys.argv[0], scope)  File "configs/example/fsSwap.py", line 86, in ?
    m5.switchCpus(switch_cpu_list)  File "build/ALPHA_FS/python/m5/__init__.py", line 206, in switchCpus    new_cpu.takeOverFrom(old_cpus[index])  File "build/ALPHA_FS/python/m5/config.py", line 570, in takeOverFrom
    self._ccObject.takeOverFrom(cpu_ptr)AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'takeOverFrom'Is there something I'm forgetting to instantiate?  Any help would be greatly appreciate.
Ps.  Thanks for setting up the WIKI page.  It has been a tremendous help, and in my opinion a great improvement over the documentation that was available for the previous version of m5.  I hope the community continues to add to it!
