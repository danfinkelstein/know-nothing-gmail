Hello,
I was wondering what the use / purpose of the 'forwardSnoops' variable
in the handleSnoop Function located in the
/src/mem/cache/cache_impl.hh file. I see that this variable is set to
'true' in the BaseCache.py file (line:49) in order to enable
forwarding from the memory side to the cpu side of the cache, but I
don't quite understand why that would need to be done? Also, since it
is by default set to true, under which circumstances would it be
useful to set it to false?
Thanks.
Malek
