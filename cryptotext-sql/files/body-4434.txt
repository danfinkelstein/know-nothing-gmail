Thanks for the guidance, Steve. I was able to get this to work.
For anyone else who is interested, this is what I did:
I followed Steve's suggestion and created a prefetch() path similar to the path that read() takes to the LSQ. The code is a little streamlined because there are Fault conditions and memory dependence issues that are important for loads but are not relevant for prefetches. Hence you can rip out a lot of related checks/special cases.
The one important difference is that prefetches don't writeback. This has a comple of consequences. First, you want to use a single execute() rather than the iniateAcc()/completeAcc() sequence for a normal load. Second, the memory hierarchy responds to the prefetch with a Read response (even if you generate the original request as a SoftPFReq). So, you have to make sure that it doesn't try to follow the conventional load writeback path.
You can do this in part by setting the LSQState to noWB when you make the request. There are a couple of places along the way that you have to check for this noWB condition (or inst->isDataPrefetch()) to make sure that the right thing is being done.
But overall, it wasn't too difficult.
Thanks, again,

Hi Russ,
It shouldn't be too hard.. basically you'd have to duplicate the path that
read() takes from BaseDynInst through the CPU object (e.g., AlphaO3CPU) to
the o3 LSQ with prefetch() functions that will be similar.  Once you get to
the LSQ then the key difference is to set the command field of the packet
you send to the dcache to SoftPFReq rather than ReadReq.
Maybe Kevin can speak up if there are subtleties I'm not aware of.
Let us know if it's not that simple...

Hi,
It looks as if software prefetch instructions are ignored by the O3 model
in the m5 2.0 release (e.g. they 'execute' and 'commit' but do not impact
the microarchitectural state). In particular,
BaseDynInst<Impl>::prefetch(Addr addr, unsigned flags) does nothing.
How difficult would it be to re-enable swp?
Thanks,
Russ
