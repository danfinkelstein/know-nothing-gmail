Hi,
  Sorry for the delayed response.  Since I set most of this up for a paper submission, I have only simulated the system that we were interested in (64 cores).  Below are approximate simulation times for that system on our Condor cluster (2 & 4 core P4 Xeons and 2 core Opterons):
 
  -------64 cores-----------
                   simsmall:     simmedium:    simlarge:  - blackscholes   00d05h10m     00d16h24m     01d22h39m  - bodytrack      02d05h27m     10d18h19m  - canneal        01d05h38m     03d03h57m
  - dedup          00d17h14m  - facesim        <- more than 20d: incomplete ->  - ferret         00d22h48m     02d23h49m  - fluidanimate   02d14h40m     02d20h03m  - freqmine       02d04h20m     04d18h53m
  - vips           02d20h07m     05d15h32m  - x264                         11d01h32m
  -------64 cores-----------
  Mark, another student in our group, might be able to give better estimates for systems with fewer simulated cores.  Hopefully this is useful,

Hello the problem was a very bad programming that I did, I definedthis counters to count the number of the access depending on the src:
static double My_counters[9][9];I did that for SE mode and using the flags I verify that the maximumsrc number for SE it was 9, so I put that 9 in the definition after Iforgot to change the size and I switch to FS. In FS mode the src
numbers are bigger so in my code it was writing in other memory space,and you can imagine the problem. Sorry about this stupid problem andthanks for the help Ali.I would like to seize the opportunity of send this email, and ask Joel
if he can give us the estimated simulation time for the benchmarks.Thanks.
