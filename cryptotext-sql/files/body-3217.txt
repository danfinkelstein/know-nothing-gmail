I was having trouble running the SPEC2K CINT benchmarks at first, but once I started using cpu2000.py the problems with inputs/command lines seemed to go away.I'm pretty sure I run the mcf done in the regression testing which is about ~1 million instructions I believe...- Show quoted text -

I am not using CPU2000.py. I am passing the input file using process.input.
