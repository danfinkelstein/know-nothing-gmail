i am trying to run cpu2000 benchmarks in full system mode, and already compiled the benchmarks using the crosscompiler. after copying the binaries to the image i then tried running the benchmarks within the simulated system. i got the error # ../TimberWolfSC stdcellmodprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No such file or directorymodprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No such file or directoryafter looking around the net for a while i came upon this message wherein steve advised another user to have the benchmark(it was not exactly the same benchmark though) statically linked to get around this. i then tried statically linking twolf by adding "-static" to the makefile's "gcc" argument and then crosscompiling again. the binary's size did increase, but the results are still the same, it still looks for modules.dep. any ideas? thanks a lot.
