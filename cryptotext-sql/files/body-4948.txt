I'm having similar problems in SE mode for the O3CPU when I set cache
latencies all to 1.  In that case I get the validCpuAndThreadNums
error.  Using real latencies I get a different error that was not
mentioned by Nikos Anastopoulos.  The errors occur both with SMT and
single-threaded execution, albeit at different cycles.
m5.opt: build/ALPHA_SE/cpu/base_dyn_inst_impl.hh:125: void
BaseDynInst<Impl>::initVars() [with Impl = O3CPUImpl]: Assertion
`instcount <= 1500' failed.
Program aborted at cycle 7197
My cache is based upon the simple-timing.py test script.  Removing the
caches removes the errors.
I have installed the patch.
