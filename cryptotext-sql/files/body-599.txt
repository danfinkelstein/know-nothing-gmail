Hi,
Is it possible to simulate workloads in a multiprocessor system with
'n' cores each with multithreading capability of 'm' threads such that
checkpoint restoration points (each checkpoint dump created using a
uniprocessor configuration as demonstrated in the ASPLOS tutorial) for
each of those workloads can be specified?
For e.g., consider a system with 2 cores (each with SMT of 2) running
4 workloads (w0-w3)
core0 - [w0 , w1]
core1 - [w2 , w3]
But those workloads should be restored from separate checkpoints
(which may be created using simpoint values).
I am working in SE mode. I searched through some past posts on m5 but
could not find any discussion that talked about this.
regards,
Soumyaroop
