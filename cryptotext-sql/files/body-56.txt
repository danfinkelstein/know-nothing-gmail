Hello,
I'm trying again to get the hardware L2 prefetcher to work in an attempt to model the Nehalem architecture more accurately in FS mode. I enabled the prefetcher in CacheConfig.py as follows:
-system.l2 = L2Cache(size='2MB')
+system.l2 = L2Cache(size='8MB', assoc=16, latency='49ns', prefetch_policy='ghb', prefetch_degree=2, prefetcher_size=64)
Now when I run various SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks, I tend to get segfaults in the benchmarks and in the kernel as well. Switching back to the regular L2Cache gives correct behavior. I am using PhysicalMemory and all other defaults. I have compiled kernel v2.6.27 and am using the cross compiler provided on the website. GemsFDTD/test tends to give a segfault, mcf/test tends to deadlock after some time. Anyone have some idea why this is happening or how to fix it?
Joe
