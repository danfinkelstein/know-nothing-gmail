Hello! I'm new to the list.
I have read on your website that "M5 models a DEC Tsunami system in
sufficient detail to boot unmodified Linux 2.4/2.6, FreeBSD, or
L4Ka::Pistachio".
Given this wonderful capability, how can I use this software?
I was expecting some documentation like the following one, detailing
how to install and to run Debian GNU/Linux on MIPS machine emulated by
QEMU.
http://www.aurel32.net/info/debian_mips_qemu.php
Ok, being more concrete,
1. Can I boot to SRM console?
2. Can I load initrd, in addition to kernel?
3. Am I correct in that stripped kernel can't be used?
