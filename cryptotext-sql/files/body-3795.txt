I noticed that occupyBus() sets pkt->firstWordTime and 
pkt->finishTime. However, these variables are only utilized 
by Cache::handleResponse(). What if the packet is a request? I'm just 
wondering how firstWordTime and finishTime is handled in all cases.
 
Thanks!

  Subject: [m5-users] bus latency 
modeling
  
  I have a question regarding  Bus::recvTiming
   
  In this function, occupyBus() calculates when the packet is received 
  completely by dest_port (tickNextIdle). However, "sendTiming" is executed 
  instantly afterwards without delay (both to dest_port and snoop ports). I 
  understand the "adding instead of dividing" trick, but for this latency model 
  to be effective, shouldn't the dest_port and snoop ports see the packet at 
  tickNextIdle?  Am I missing something?
   
  Thanks!
