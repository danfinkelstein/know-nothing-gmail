Hi,
 
Am looking to model a CMP based system. Wanted to try and model the memory system accurately as well. So wanted to interface M5 with DRAMsim - http://www.enee.umd.edu/dramsim/#version2
 . 
 
Wanted to interface it in an execution-driven fashion. Has anybody else perhaps already tried doing this? I know there are ports of DRAMsim that work with SimpleScalar and GEMs. Is there anything about the software organization of M5 that makes interfacing with M5 potentially easier/harder? Any advice on how to go about doing this would be greatly appreciated.
 
By the way, does anybody know how the existing built-in detailed memory models of M5 compare with DRAMsim?
 
Thanks very much,
Shyam
