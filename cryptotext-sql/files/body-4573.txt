Right now only caches are set up to take a mem_trace parameter.  You
have to decide which cache you want to assign it to; it would look
something like:
root.server.cpu.dcache.mem_trace = M5Writer(filename = 'tracefile')
If you really want to trace just the traffic going into the main memory
module, it looks like the C++ code is set up to take a mem_trace
parameter (looking at m5/mem/memory_builder.cc) but the parameter was
left out of the python code.  You might be able to enable that just by
copying the 'mem_trace = Param.MemTraceWriter' line from BaseCache.py to
BaseMemory.py.
