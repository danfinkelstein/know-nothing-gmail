I like the idea, but not the name. m5-out or m5_out or maybe just output seem like better names.

Currently, the default output directory of m5 is the current working

never want M5 to litter the current working directory with output.
How do people feel about me making the default output directory
"./m5.out".  This could of course be overridden with the -d option as
usual.  I will also be creating a .m5rc in the near future where all
of these options can be easily set, so if people hate the idea I can
do it in my own .m5rc file.
