Hi Rick,It think it may be the input file names.  Many of the SPEC2k benchmarks get input files redirected to their STDIN.  For example, parser has the following command line (from 
http://kbarr.net/specint2000-commandlines):    parser 2.1.dict -batch < ref.in > ref.out 2> ref.errI think this code in cpu2000.py provides the input files to STDIN for many of these benchmarks:
       if not hasattr(self.__class__, 'stdin'):            self.stdin = joinpath(inputs_dir, '%s.in' % self.name)            if not isfile(self.stdin):                
self.stdin = NoneIt looks to me like, unless otherwise specified, parser would get a STDIN of filename "parser.in".  Since this is (likely) not a file in your SPEC directory, parser probably doesn't get a proper input file.  I don't see anywhere else that the 
self.stdin parameter is set for parser in cpu2000.py either.If this is the problem, renaming (or copying and renaming) the ref.in file as "parser.in" would solve the problem, or else add the line:
        self.stdin = 'ref.in'...to the cpu2000.py where it sets up the "parser" benchmark.Specifically, I believe I've gotten parser to run by doing the former (creating a file 
parser.in).  I haven't tried facerec or the others you mention, but according to Ken's website, they all are similar (taking either ref.in or 
inp.in on their STDIN).   -Vilas- Show quoted text -On Jan 7, 2008 4:52 PM, Steve Reinhardt <stever@gmail.com> wrote:
If I had to make a wild guess, I think you may be having problems withinput or output files not being accessible, or maybe being corrupted.I'm not sure what compiler your binaries were compiled with, or if
fortran error numbers are standardized, but error 24 is "End-of-fileduring read" for DEC Fortran:http://www.helsinki.fi/atk/unix/dec_manuals/df90au52/dfum033.htm
The rest of that error message just says that it tried to look up thetext error message for that error number but couldn't find the filethat does that.SImilarly with lucas, if the program is calling exit() after 80K
instructions it's because something very early went wrong, like itdidn't like the command-line arguments or couldn't find an input file. I'm very surprised you're not getting an error message somewhere
(from the app if not from m5).That reminds me... could the command-line arg issues we were havingwith the splash scripts (where you need to manually split the commandline into args) be an issue here too?
