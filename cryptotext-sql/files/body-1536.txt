Hi all,
I am writing a memory debugger that sits in between L1 and the cpu. It
maintains a functional memory (like MemTest) that mimics the actions the
memory actions and tests the values for problems. I would like to be
able to plug this in right after restoring a checkpoint when the
physical memory has values (from checkpoint) but the functional memory
is blank. Is there an easy way to initialize a functional memory from a
physical memory?
Also, I see references to MemDebugger class in the cache implementations
which makes me think someone else has gone down this road before. Any
one know anything?
Thanks,
-Rick
