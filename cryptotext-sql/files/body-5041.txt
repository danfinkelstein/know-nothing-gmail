I just added that check... try commenting it out (search for 'zlib' in m5/SConstruct) and replacing it with this:
env.Append(LIBS=['z'])
and see if you can compile anyway.  If so, then there's something messed up with the way scons is checking for the library.

Hi all,
I've recently upgraded to m5 2.0 beta 1 with the first patch and, as  a result, also upgraded my Python, scons, and swig installations.  When I run the first sanity check, 'scons build/ALPHA_SE/tests/debug/ quick' I get this error:
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
Checking for main() in C++ library z... no
Error: did not find needed zlib compression library and/or zlib.h  header file.
        Please install zlib and try again.
I'm on CentOS 4.3 and both zlib and zlib-dev are installed as both  regular packages as well as the latest versions in /usr/local. This  looks like an easy fix to do, somehow, if I knew how to do it...
Best regards,
Dan
