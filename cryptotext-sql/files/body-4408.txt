Hi,
I've got a few quick questions about M5 and Transactional Memory, and
would really appreciate any answers from the M5 community.
* Are there any efforts underway to support TM in M5?
* Would anyone else be interested in starting some form of collaborative
effort to bring some of the TM models to M5?
* Can anyone foresee any potential problems/issues/blocks to pursuing
such an effort?
Thanks,
