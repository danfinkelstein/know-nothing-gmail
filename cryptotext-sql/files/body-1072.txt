Simpoints are an intrinsic feature of workloads - if you want to take a checkpoint at a simpoint, you must do --take-checkpoint 0 --simpoint, as described in our asplos tutorial.  If you look in cpu2000.py, the simpoint parameters are part of each benchmark.

HiI want to use the simpoint values of the benchmarks. I do add the command line parameters "-simpoint --take-checkpoint=100000000". Also I have tried to run the simulations with taking 0 simpoint value and  benchmark simpoint value. 
The result in the stats file doesn't get effected, its same every time. So it seems that simpoint is not working. But when I set the simpoint value, it reflected changes in config.ini file with the same assigned simpoint value( whether it is 0 or some value). So it is not clear whether it is working or not.
Thanks in advance Ashutosh Jain
