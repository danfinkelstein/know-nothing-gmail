Hi, nathan,thanks for your reply.  The bit that marks the address as an uncached access is 43 bit, in the 0xffff fdxx xxxx xxxx that you mentioned, it's the highest bit of the  "d".  I supposed that the 0xffff fcff ffff ffff is the address mask.
In this cace, how should I specify an uncached access address ? Can I specify the address like this:  0xffff f8xx xxxx xxxx and the mask is 0xffff f7ff ffff ffff ? Thank you !
You have to be careful to differentiate the physical address space
from the virtual address space.  The stuff you got from isa_traits.hh
is virtual address space and describes the superpage stuff that you
can find in the processor documentation.  the address with the high
bit set that you've described is a physical address (with the high bit
set so you can do an uncached access.
Assuming that you want to do an uncached access to a specific physical
address, you're probably going to want an address that looks like
0xfffffdxxxxxxxxxx.  The 0xfffffc part is the K0Seg super page.  The
bit that turns the 'c' into a 'd' should be the uncacheable bit.  You
can look through the configuration files to find other examples of
uncached addresses.
