Hello,I am compiling Ferret from PARSEC 2.0 and I got this panic in m5: panic: attempt to execute unimplemented instruction 'maxuw4' (inst 0x723007a4, opcode 0x1c)
> Â @ cycle 2367067420500
> [execute:build/ALPHA_FS/arch/alpha/o3_cpu_exec.cc, line 70]Any clues on how fix this? One way is to implement the instructions, other way is probably to find some sort of compiling flag to not produce this instructions. Anyways any advice, experience or thoughts on this problem is appreciated.
ThanksEF
