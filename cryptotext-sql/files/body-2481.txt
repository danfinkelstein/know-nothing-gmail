Hi all,
So I tried to run splash benchmarks with more than 1 O3 cpu, and I get
the error message, "nxm_threade_create: no idle contexts available". It
appears that the O3CPU thread contexts are not being set to unallocated
according to some emails I saw involving Sujay Phadke. Did we ever
commit the fix to the O3CPU? If so, i don't see it.
Best,
-Rick
