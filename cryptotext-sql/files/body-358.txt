Hi,
I am looking for a way to reset/dump stats from the application itself
in ALPHA_FS mode.
As I understood, all the pseudoinsts as part of the m5 util only works
in the rcS script which
does not understand where the program is in a finer granularity.
Is there a way to do so already in M5?
The method I am working on is based on a memory mapped variable. And
whenever I see a
write to it, I am trying to reset/dump stats. The  do_reset_stats
functions though are in util directory
instead of src. So the default compilation script is not going to
support that. I have some trouble
calling back to these psudoinsts from the cache mode itself.
Do you think this is the right way to go or is there is better way?
Thanks for your help in advance.
john
