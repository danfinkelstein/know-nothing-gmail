You can record the statistics every 100 million instructions and then throw away ever other recording, however there currently isn't a way to specify every other period although it wouldn't be hard to add.
We have a pseudo instruction that we use to dump/reset the stats. You can see the implementation in m5/util/m5/m5op_alpha.S, search for: m5_dumpreset_stats. The implementation is is the alpha isa description file and src/sim/pseudo_insts.cc, but simply if you call that assembly as a function where the first parameter is when you want to dump and reset the statistics.
Right now the first parameter it takes is the tick to dump/reset and the next is the number of ticks to wait before repeating the dump/reset. If you removed both parameters from the pseudo_inst.cc call to StatEvent() it would happen immediately and never happen again which is probably what you want.
As for selectively dumping some stats and not dumping others we don't support anything like that currently.

I am doing a multicore simulation and I only want to measure cache misses during the guest application's parallel phase
I added two systemcalls which tells m5 to start measure and stop messure, the system calls will be called by the guest application when it reaches its parallel phase.
I can get around it by using my own variables. But Â I LOVE m5 and I would prefer to use its stats if possible.
It's a pity that the functionality is turned off. Is there a patch for it?
Thanks!
