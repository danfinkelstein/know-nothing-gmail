This is a special purpose address, though I can't quite remember what
it is.  I vaguely recall that this might be an EV6 IPR that is memory
mapped (which means that it's for controlling the cache).  You can
look it up in the manuals to figure it out, or try to get a backtrace
of the kernel where this happens (using the remote debugger).
