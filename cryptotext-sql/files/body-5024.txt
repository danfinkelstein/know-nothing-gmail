Hi all,After downloading, compiling, and setting up m5 to run in the full
system mode, I tried to boot the simulator in the detailed mode with:
./m5.fast -d output/ configs/example/fs.py -d
and I get the following error:
M5 compiled Sep  1 2006 17:35:27
M5 started Tue Sep  5 14:08:08 2006
M5 executing on idealjames
command line: ./m5.fast -d output/ configs/example/fs.py -d
panic: Simulator object type 'DerivO3CPU' not found.
 @ cycle 0
[createObject:build/ALPHA_FS/sim/builder.cc, line 121]
Program aborted at cycle 0
Aborted
Note that the system boots perfectly with the -t (for timing mode) or
with no argument (atomic mode). I found the Deriv03CPU class within the
src/python/m5/objects directory and attempted to setup symlinks to see
if this was simply a path error of some sort, but I have never used
Python before and didn't have much luck. I have also installed the
latest patch for m5 beta 2.I also posted this as a bug in the "Flyspray" bug tracker linked off of the website (I noticed I was the first, is this up and running yet?).Thanks
