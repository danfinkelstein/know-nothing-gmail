Yes, the whole reason for having an IO cache is to make device
accesses work in coherent space.  An IO cache isn't the only solution
but it's the only one we have in m5.  You might be able to get away
with doing a broadcast invalidate on full-block DMA writes, but
partial-block DMA writes require getting an exclusive copy of the
block and then merging in the DMA data.
