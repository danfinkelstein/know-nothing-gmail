Hmm that sounds like a bug. What are you running? Can you give us a snippet of the instruction trace around that instruction for both the timing and the detailed cpu? The only thing I can think of is that the o3 cpu speculates on a load or store, however it should realize that was the bad path and that fault shouldn't matter.

when i run some benchmarks using detailed model, I have the error, fault:unalign detected at PC XXX, while it doesnot occur with timing model. Any insight?
