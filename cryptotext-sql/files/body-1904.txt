I don't know the details, but I believe there is some special Fortran runtime code that C doesn't use, and perhaps merely linking with -static doesn't actually get that linked in.
 
I'm surprised you wouldn't get some error or warning about an unimplemented syscall or a file that's not found before you got the segfault though.

Hi,I have compiled the SPECcpu2000 v1.2 natively on an Alpha machinerunning Linux. All C benchmarks seem to be executing without any problem
in m5 SE mode. However, when I try to execute any fortran benchmark, Iget an error like the one below:M5 compiled Feb 16 2009 19:27:08M5 revision 5591:be93223fd0c3c8faabbd337db9e5e576c8905397M5 commit date Mon Dec 15 18:10:21 2008 +0100

Am I missing something?Thanks in advance,Nikolas_______________________________________________m5-users mailing listm5-users@m5sim.orghttp://m5sim.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/m5-users
