Thanks Ali.Actually, the booting problem of the extended disk image was because the image wasn't labeled (i.e. partitioned) properly.After successful labeling, the simulation proceeds to the point reading kernels and configuring services via SMF.
But as soon as the SMF stages pass, I get following error and the m5sim refuses to show me its login prompt.
Since this does not happen with the original disk image, I believe there should be some workaround.
Any suggestions?

I don't have any other guidance for  you, you'll just have to spendsome time figuring it out.Option 1 will work, but like I said you'll have to modify the mmdiskdevice to be a good bit smarter and properly create a partition table
for the two disks. I know it is possible to make it work because bothlegion and sam do this.As for option 2 I don't know I'm not at all surprised that the systemwon't boot if you can't create a run installboot on the image because
it won't have a proper boot block then. The only other thing thatcomes to mind is doing this on a real physical disk and then dding thecontents into a image.AliOn Nov 22, 2007, at 11:39 PM, Lee Henry wrote:
