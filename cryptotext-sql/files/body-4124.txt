Hi,
I am trying to get checkpoints working with ALPHA_SE and have run into
some problems. When I try to resume a checkpoint I get a fatal message
in src/mem/page_table.cc:110 fatal("PageTable::allocate: address 0x%x already mapped", vaddr);. It
appears that an address has already been mapped in the page table  Why
would this happen? Has anyone at least tried making checkpoint for a
spec2000 benchmark and resuming it for ALPHA_SE? Perhaps I am running code at the start of the binary after I restore the checkpoint?

I make a checkpoint using:
./build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug  configs/example/se.py  --max_checkpoints=2 
--take_checkpoints="10000,100"  --checkpoint_dir=./checkpoints
I then try to resume a checkpoint with a AtomicSimpleCPU by the command:
$m5-2.0b3*11:57:44=>./build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug  configs/example/se.py  -r 1 --checkpoint_dir=./checkpoints
