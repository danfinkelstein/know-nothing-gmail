Hey all,
 
I was meassuring l1 cache misses when I found the L1 Icache 
has write accesses and most or all of them results in misses. This appears 
strange to me because my test code doesn't have self-modifying 
behavior.
 
What I did was inserting the counters into Cache::handleAccess 
in mem/cache_impl.hh. I test read/write using pkt->isWrite(). 
and  if the returning blk is null, I will increase the read/write miss 
counters. 
 
Am I doing the right thing? My system config is a CMP 
structure with private L1 Icaches and Dcaches,  and a shared L2. The 
coherence protocol is moesi. 
 
Thanks!
