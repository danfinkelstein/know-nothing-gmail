I believe the problem here is that cpu and
cpu2 need to be part of the system (somewhere) in order to be instantiated by m5’s
configuration parsing.  The error that it’s giving you means that
you didn’t have those two CPUs as part of the configuration that actually
gets instantiated.  Thus when it tries to switch between the CPUs, it
finds that the CPUs have no corresponding object within the running instance of
m5.  Try making your switch_cpu_list as a child of either the root object or
a system object (I believe you should just be able to do “root.switch_cpus
= switch_cpu_list” or something along those lines).  I’ll try
to clean up the Wiki to clarify that when I get a better example.

Subject: [m5-users] Using the
SwitchCpu function
 
I am trying to use the m5.switchCpus function to quickly simulate pass
the linux booting stage, and then switch to detailed mode after the full system
is booted.  I followed the wiki page and have made minor modifications to
the fs.py example script including:
cpu = AtomicSimpleCPU()
cpu2 = DetailedO3CPU()
mem_mode = 'timing'
.
.
.
switch_cpu_list = [(cpu,cpu2)]
m5.simulate(3663496423522) 
m5.switchCpus(switch_cpu_list) 
exit_event = m5.simulate(maxtick)
Most other options I've left the same from the fs.py script, but when I run the
simulator, it works perfectly until the switch point and then dies with:
Switching CPUs 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in ?
  File "build/ALPHA_FS/python/m5/main.py", line 314, in main
    execfile(sys.argv[0], scope)

    m5.switchCpus(switch_cpu_list)

takeOverFrom 
    self._ccObject.takeOverFrom(cpu_ptr)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'takeOverFrom'
Is there something I'm forgetting to instantiate?  Any help would be
greatly appreciate.
Ps.  Thanks for setting up the WIKI page.  It has been a tremendous
help, and in my opinion a great improvement over the documentation that was
available for the previous version of m5.  I hope the community continues
to add to it!
