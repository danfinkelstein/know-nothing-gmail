Sorry, I misread that. Yea, one DynInst contains one StaticInst.
Just to be a little more precise on this: each DynInst corresponds to a single StaticInst, but a StaticInst generates a new DynInst every time it is executed, so it's many-to-one in the other direction.Â  For a single-CPU system with a SimpleCPU model you'll only have one DynInst in existence at any point in time, but once you go to multiple CPUs and/or a pipelined CPU model you could have multiple DynInsts for a single StaticInst existing concurrently.
