Dear all,
I want to run some multi-threaded benchmarks, which use sockets for
communication, in m5 FS mode.
I don't know how to get the network up. Could someone please inform me
how to do it?
Thank you very much, in advance!
Best Regards,
Arun
PS:
I set a host name, assign a static IP to the simulated system, and
added an entry for loopback in /etc/hosts, but I haven't been
successful.
These are the things I did:
1) hostname sim
2) /sbin/ifconfig eth0 192.168.10.12 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast
192.168.10.255
3) Added the following lines to /etc/hosts:
127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain localhost
192.168.10.12 sim sim
But when I try to ping 127.0.0.1, I get the error:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
ping: sendto: Network is unreachable
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
When I try to ping 192.168.10.12, I get this error:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
