Thanks very much for your help! I will try to see how things can
work with SPARC_FS but since I will need a multicore system I think there are
many things to do first.
 
Although your info was of great help!
 
Thanks

Subject: Re: [m5-users] JVM on M5
 
Yea, that's right... there is
no good JVM for Alpha.  The ISA died too soon.  I agree that the way
to do this is to use SPARC_FS.  There will be a few hiccups there since
it's not as widely used but we'd be glad to help work through those if you're
up for trying.

correct me if I'm wrong.
 
I looked into it a while ago - since we really only have
ALPHA as the totally mature FS, you'd need a JVM for Alpha, which there used to
be one that was under development but seeing as I can't find it on the web
anymore I think it might be a dead project.
 
It would be much simpler to find a JVM for Sparc, but I'm
not up on how much is going on with SPARC_FS right now.

Hi,
 
I want to use M5 for some Java programs simulation. I was
wondering if there is a support of JVM on M5 FS? Does anyone have an
information on how I can execute Java programs on FS mode?
 
Thanks
