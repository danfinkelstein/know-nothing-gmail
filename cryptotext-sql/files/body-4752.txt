I found a quick hack to solve this problem in the SE mode. The
following is my method, and I hope it makes sense.
In the cache/cache_impl.hh/Cache::access, I add the extra codes to
control the req->paddr.
     tmp_addr=req->paddr;
     req->paddr  = req->paddr | (Addr)req->xc->cpu_id<< sizeof(Addr) * 8-16;
Before every return, I copy the original paddr to req->paddr.
    req->paddr=tmp_addr;
This method separates the references from different processes and
only affects the timing model. The modification works under simple cpu
and detailed cpu. At first, I try to control the asid, but it seems
not work under simple cpu.
Please tell me if there has anything that I didn't consider.- Show quoted text -
