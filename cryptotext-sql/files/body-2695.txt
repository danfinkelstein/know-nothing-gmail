hi all,
i am reading o3 model these days, and i don't quite understand how the data is fetched from cache to cpu...
can anyone tell me some details about the whole process? i am not sure if it is something to do with the 'read' and 'write' function in src\cpu\o3\Lsq.hh? 
i don't quite understand the two functions, can anyone give me some help, thanks a lot...-- RegardsDengningSchool Of Computer Science and Technology Beijng Institute of Technology, China, 100081
