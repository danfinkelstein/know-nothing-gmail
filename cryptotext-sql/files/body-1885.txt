I'm a little confused by your comments... the Request object has
fields for pc, _threadID, and _contextID (which is a combined
cpu/thread ID, equivalent to the cpu ID for non-multithreaded cores).
I believe we're pretty good about setting them when appropriate.
(Some operations, like writebacks, don't have meaningful values that
you can assign there.)  A pointer to the same request object is
generally passed around to all the Packet objects associated with the
original request, so ince that information is set it should not get
lost in the memory system.
There is an INST_READ flag in the request too that logically ought to
signal an instruction fetch, though I see that the cores generally
don't set that flag.  That should be easy to fix though.  There's also
a VPTE bit that indicates a page-table read on Alpha, though what if
anything other ISAs do to distinguish page-table accesses I don't
know.
