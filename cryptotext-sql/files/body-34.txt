Thanks Lisa.I should've payed more attention to his configuration: "I'm running one core, with one thread, split level 1 caches and physical memory."MSHRs arent really a big deal in that case.
Max,if you just go into the physical memory object and create relevant read/write statistics you can be sure of the values you get.- Show quoted text -On Fri, Jun 4, 2010 at 12:23 PM, Lisa Hsu <hsul@eecs.umich.edu> wrote:
I assume the InOrderCPU has blocking caches in which case you will definitely have no mshr hits, since each core only has one outstanding memory request at a time.

Korey,
Could it be that in the InOrderCPU, all mshr accesses are misses? But
only for the dcache.
I have over a hundred traces of programs that have executed more than
140 million instructions all showing the same thing:
overall_mshr_hits=0.
The overal_misses of the dcache equals overall_mshr_misses of the
dcache.
If it would help I could send my config-file.
This entry in the config-file says that I do have mshrs for the dcache:
[system.cpu.dcache]
.....
mshrs=10
.....
Regards,
Max

  The
number of memory writes will be more difficult to calculate: it equals
[number of evicted cache lines that were written] plus [number of data
cache WriteReq_misses].
  
  Check the stats for "MSHR" misses there (and corresponding code
if you want to know when that gets updated). Y
  
You could technically have a miss to the same block that a MSHR is
handling, so that "miss" is kind of being double-serviced so to speak.
