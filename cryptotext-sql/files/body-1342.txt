You are right that you need to download those files. You might be able
to get them through the "Full System Files" link at
http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Download, but I haven't actually
looked in that tarball to check. We run that regression regularly, so
once you have all the right files you should be able to run it
yourself without any problems. Our SPARC support isn't as mature as
our Alpha support, but it is there and does work in most cases.
