Is it possible to quantify the accuracy of the memory timing model with a
real piece of hardware? Lets say we put in real numbers for the various
latencies and other parameters to make it close to a real SDRAM. Will it be
useful to run memory intensive benchmarks and see how the timing numbers
match up with those on a real system? (timing correction, batch latency
calculation, etc. implemented in the dram.cc)
