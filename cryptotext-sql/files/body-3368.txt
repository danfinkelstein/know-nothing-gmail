Our research group is evaluating M5 as a possible new simulator standard.  Some key information I have not been able to find anywhere, so your help is greatly appreciated:
(1) Full system simulation on SPARC:  The Docs imply this is available, but the tutorial implies you still can only do a full system simulation on an Alpha.  Can I get hardware acceleration out of a SPARC machine?
(2) Simulation speed.  I need a sense of both the software and hardware performance in instructions/second.  This is a critical piece of information and I have not found it anywhere in the docs or tutorial.  I would even accept anecdotal information about M5 speed.
Thanks so much for your help,
- Jeff
