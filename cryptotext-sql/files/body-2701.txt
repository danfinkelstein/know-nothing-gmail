I want to configure a uniform L1 cache and a noununiform L2 cache.L2
cache will assign different latency to different part of address. I am
trying to create a new function to calculate hitLatency in the c code,
and hope this function code only affect L2 cache, rather than affect
both caches.In this case, I want to add a flag in the function like
"uniformFlag". Then I set the value of flag in python configuration
file. For example, in my fs.py,  I set:
test_sys.cpu.addPrivateSplitL1Caches(L1Cache(size = '32kB', uniformFlag
= 1), L2Cache(size = '64kB', uniformFlag = 1))
test_sys.l2=L2Cache(size = '2MB', uniformFlag = 0)
In the c code, I use a new function CalhitLatency (PacketPtr pkt, int
uniformFlag) to replace all "hitLatency" variables.
int CalhitLatency (PachetPtr pkt, int uniformFlag)
{   int lat;
    if (uniformFlag) {  lat = hitLatency; }
    else {
        addr = pkt->getAddr();
              /* here add code to assign lat depending on the address */
   }
    return lat;
}
Is it possible to get what I want in this case?
BTW, When we edit the c code, we need to recompile m5 before running it.
Is it right?
Thanks
Gary
