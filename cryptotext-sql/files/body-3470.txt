This WIKI page on SPEC2K might be able to help you out if you can get
your spec distribution under a certain format:
http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/SPEC2000_benchmarks
There are a number of small changes from m5 1.1. to m5.2.0.b4 in terms
of configuring your simulation so if you're looking to move to 2.0 you
might have to scrap (or alter) your config files to the new way.
For instance, I'm not sure configuring options in a
'DetailedUniConfig.py' is file is necessary anymore (if I remember
correctly that's how you configure m5-1.1. models by compiling them
in).
Rather, you may just have to use the '-d' command line option for the
detailed model and in the configs/example/se.py file you can configure
a Detailed model after it has been instantiated further down in the
se.py file:
CPUClass.<option> = <value>;
Hope that helps you on your way...
