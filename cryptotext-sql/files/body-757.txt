Hello,
   I want to simulate a system which has 2 different main memory modules
and 2 buses which connect it to the L2, with different address ranges.
(something like a dancehall). Is it straightforward to do this or would
it affect the coherency protocols, or something else in the system?
Secondly, would the changes I make be any different if I use the ruby
models instead of the inbuilt dram models?
thanks,
Sujay
