To be a bit more explicit, we don't have any models for this sort of thing.  M5 has a lot of framework that will help you get started, but you're going to have to do a fair amount of hacking.  I personally am going to start working on some interconnect stuff and I'm going to use M5 because it has a good framework to begin with.
  Nate- Show quoted text -
We designed M5 so that any sorts of interconnects would be implementable by
those who want it using our API of ports to connect between various
elements, but nothing like that has been done before on M5, as far as we
know.  Let us know how it goes or what we can do to help.

Hello everybody,
   I'm planning on studying omega networks as an initial work in using m5
simulator. Is it possible to implement/simulate omega networks using the M5
simulator? Thanks.
