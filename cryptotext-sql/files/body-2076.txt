The built-in DRAM system is completely borked, just so you know. The
latencies the code actually uses are ticks, but the interface still
gives it as cycles. Combined with a number of other issues.

To get a number of the parameters, you need to compute them from the
manufacturer specified parameters using information in the appropriate
JEDEC standard. This is not to say that the parameters in the built-in
module are correct, but the standards have every possible parameter
named, described, and detailed.

Either that, or construct your own configuration.

Since it derives from PhysicalMemory, they have all the same
parameters as it does. The range is set in exactly the same way.

I have a mostly complete DRAMSim integration, but there are some
licensing issues that have yet to be worked out as far as distributing
it with M5. I can probably directly give you a copy of my patch, but I
do not have it collected at this time.
