To my knowledge, there is no path for this sort of notification.
There are a couple of options.  The most accurate would be to create a
new command called MissNotification, and add an option to the cache to
generate miss notification requests upon a miss and have the cache
send the message back to the source of the initial request.  Then
you'd have to modify the CPU code to do something with that
MissNotification message.
Anyone have any better ideas?
