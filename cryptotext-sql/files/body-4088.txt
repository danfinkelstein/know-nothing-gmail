Hi,
I have followed the steps shown in the documents,but I still
got the following error:
$ sh demo-alpha.sh
........
applying patch /home/x/crosstool-0.43/patches/glibc-2.3.5/arm-ctl_bus_isa.patch
getandpatch.sh: 1: patch: not found
patch /home/x/crosstool-0.43/patches/glibc-2.3.5/arm-ctl_bus_isa.patch failed
Does anyone know how to solve it? Thanks.
