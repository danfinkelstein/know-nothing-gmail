Hi all,
It is my first time to use the M5 simulator and I had trouble
figuring out how to use it. I am running M5 on cygwin. After
compiling M5 in FS mode, I tried to run some benchmark on it.
For example:
$ ./build/alpha_fs/m5.opt ./configs/example/fs.py -b MutexTest
The output is as follows:
M5 Simulator System

M5 compiled xxxxxxxxxxx

M5 executing on xxxxxxxx
command line: ./build/alpha_fs/m5.opt ./configs/example/fs.py -b MutexTest

Could you tell me how to deal with this problem?
BTW: I am not very familiar with Linux/Unix, so please explain
as detailedly as you could. Thanks a lot.
In my research, I need to run an application in parallel on some parallel system(network of workstations). Could I use
M5 to simulate the parallel system and have the application
run on it? If yes,according to my understanding, I just need
to modify file fs.py  and recompile the application with some
alpha compiler. Correct me if I am wrong.
Xin
