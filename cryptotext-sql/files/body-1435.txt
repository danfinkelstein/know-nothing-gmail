There is a way for you to do this, but it won't really work. The
problem is that a lot of programs expect to run things that are
compiled with the selected compiler when they're being configured. You
may have seen messages when building something where there's a sanity
check to make sure the compiler can generate a functioning executable.
Beyond little but tricky hangups like that it should work in theory.
In the end it would be much less headache to do a real install or run
under some sort of speedy emulation like maybe QEMU than to try to
cross compile.
