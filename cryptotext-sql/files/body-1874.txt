Note though, that maxtick is in terms of ticks, and not instructions.I believe max-tick only works post-checkpoint or fastforwarding, but it's easy to extend. Â Just grep for how options.max_inst is used in Simulation.py and extrapolate - you can easily add it to stop on a non-ff or non-checkpointed run in your own se/fs.py.
