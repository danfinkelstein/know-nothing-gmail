What exactly are you trying to mask?  If you're trying to get the
physical address look in the TLB code to see exactly what it does.  M5
is somewhat strange in this regard because we use EV5 palcode but use
an EV6 processor model.  The EV5 specified 39 bits of physical
address, and I believe that is what we actually use.  Again, you'll
need to look in the translation code to verify things.
