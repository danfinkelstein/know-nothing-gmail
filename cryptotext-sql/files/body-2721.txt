I've committed a new event queue datastructure that should greatly
improve simulator performance for those simulations that frequently
schedule many events at the same tick/priority.  This was a pretty
common thing for me to do when I was building a mesh network model.  I
suspect that in the future as people simulate lots of simple CPU
cores, that this will help as well.
I ran all of the alpha regressions and nothing changed, so hopefully
there are no bugs, but if there are, please let me know.
