Hi,
Is SimpleTimingPort used everywhere when sendTiming is required? is there
any other derived class from port class which implements timing? It seems
that this class uses recvAtomic to get an timing estimate and uses this
estimate to schedule a response. So, how we can have more accurate timing
model? Is there any available implementation now in M5?
Thanks
