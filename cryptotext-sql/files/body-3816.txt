Just to clarify: it's using BaseBufferArg::copyIn() and not
VirtualPort::CopyIn(), right?  I just noticed that these are two
different functions with totally opposite semantics (explaining Ali's
earlier confusion).
Perhaps we should rename copyin/copyout to either copyToHost/copyToGuest, copyHostToGuest/copyGuestToHost, or copyM5ToGuest/copyGuestToM5
