Wow, this is all stuff that should buffed a bit and put on the wiki.  Any volunteers out there?  Of course, the original authors would have to agree.  I'm sure Ken would be willing to have his stuff posted.
  Nate- Show quoted text -
I'm still 99% convinced that you're not providing the right input to the
benchmarks.  How many instructions get run for each benchmark when you
run it by itself?  What command line do you use when you do that?
I agree it sounds like you're not specifying the correct benchmark
command line. Good references can be found at:
http://www.cag.lcs.mit.edu/~kbarr/cag/spec2000-commandlines.html
and
http://www.cag.lcs.mit.edu/~kbarr/cag/spec2000fp-commandlines.html
I've written some Python classes which encapsulate each of the
SPEC2000 benchmarks. They were designed for m5 v1 so might need a few
changes for m5 v2. You can find them at:

From what I remember, it makes local copies of the input files from one
read-only root. This is a little space inefficient but avoided having to
have long paths in the command lines.
