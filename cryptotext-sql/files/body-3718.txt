As UpgradeReq is used when a cache wants to transistion its
shared line to modified.  An UpgradeReq will force the other caches to
invalidate in this case, so no response is sent.  Using a ReadExReq would get
you the same result, but would cause the previous owner of the line to send a
response with the data.  So an Upgrade is an optimization to reduce
interconnect traffic.

Subject: [m5-users] what's UpgradeReq for?
- Show quoted text -
 
Hey
all,
 
I
was trying to modify the memory system to allow multiple responses for
interconnection modeling (in SE mode). However, it came to a “limit reached”
(running out of events).
 
The
last packet that my interconnection dealt with is an UpgradeReq, which doesn’t
trigger any responses. However, I’m not able to tell what it does. Can some one
shed light on it?
 
Thanks!
