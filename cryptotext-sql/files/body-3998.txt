HIi ALi,
      As you replied, we have to set the DRAM parameters independently of the simulation setup. But I feel that these default DRAM parameters are wrong, and will give wrong results for people doing timing simulation. Correct me if I am wrong.

No it means it's one tick of simulator time which is 1ps.

Hi,
I noticed that the PhysicalMemory class sets memory latency to 1t  which I assume is 1 tick from looking at the python. Does this imply  that my memory latency is 1 tick of the system.membus clock @1GHZ?
class PhysicalMemory(MemObject):
  type = 'PhysicalMemory'
  port = VectorPort("the access port")
  range = Param.AddrRange(AddrRange('128MB'), "Device Address")
  file = Param.String('', "memory mapped file")
  latency = Param.Latency('1t', "latency of an access")
  zero = Param.Bool(False, "zero initialize memory")
