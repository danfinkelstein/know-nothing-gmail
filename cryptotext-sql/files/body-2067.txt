Dear Lisa,
Thanks a lot for your quick response. The reason I was trying to use SE mode is,
when cpu is issuing an data request I need that to be something relate to my
program. I was thinking that if I am running my code in FS mode all the
addresses issued by the cpu will not be relate to my program. Please correct me
if I am wrong.
Any suggestion on how to proceed further/ any advice on changing the direction
is greatly appreciated cos I am feeling completely dark :-(
Further a small question. Could you please tell me how to execute a simple
helloworld program in FS mode. I know this is straightforward in SE mode with -c
option. I looked for this all the places, but could not found the answer, may be
its too newbie..
