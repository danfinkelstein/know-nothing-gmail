I tried to run the simulation after fixing the path of benchmarks. I gave the absolute path for every benchmarks but its still showing the instruction executed only in one cpu. Also, no matter how many CPUs I used, it only shows the eio trace for the single cpu.Could you please help me.Test your Star IQ Play now!
