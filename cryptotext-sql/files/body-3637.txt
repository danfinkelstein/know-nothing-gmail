I don't know of anyone porting BBV code, but it is true that the Alpha
instruction decoder in M5 is bug-for-bug compatible with SimpleScalar,
if you compile with the SS_COMPATIBLE_FP flag.  We need(ed) that to be
able to run SS EIO traces (not sure how much people use that feature
anymore, but initially we used it a fair amount).
