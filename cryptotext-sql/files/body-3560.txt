Jiayuan,
If you're going to create a new topic on the mailing list please create a new message instead of replying and changing the Subject: of an existing message. If you reply the In-Reply-To: and References: headers are set to the old message ids. Some mail clients use these headers to decide if a message should be displayed as part of an existing thread or as a new topic.
Thanks,

Hey all,
I have a formula that need to do calculation based on the sum of a vector. How do I write this ?
Vector v;
Formula f;
regStats()
{
  v.init(len);
  f = constant(9.0)*v.total();
}
Thanks!
Jiayuan
