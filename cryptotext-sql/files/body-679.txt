Hi,I am trying to upgrade my kernel from 2.6.13 to 2.6.27 based on the instructions found at http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Compiling_a_Linux_Kernel
One of the steps is :cp .config.m5 .configI can not find .config.m5 or .config files in the checked out directory.Â  I created my own .config file by running "make menuconfig" but couldn't figure out how to get .config.m5 . Am I missing something? Is there a better way to do this? 
I was wondering why the disk image on the website does not come with the latest version of kernel supported by m5? That could save a lot of time.Thanks.Amir
