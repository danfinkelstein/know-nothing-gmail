hi all,
  I'm trying to replicate results from a paper for a course project,
question 1:
   How can I configure a detailed cpu to have a perfect branch predictor? I looked at bpred_unit_impl.hh and there are only two types of predictor(local and tournament.) Does this mean I am going to add a new object into M5(write C++ code for perfect_branch_predictor, then instantiate it using python)?
question 2:
   How about a perfect L2 cache? Should I just increase the L2 cache size to say 100MB to reduce the miss rate?
Thanks a lot,
-dean michael
