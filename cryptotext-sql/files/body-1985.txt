Dear Veydan
If you need to do modifications to the splash code, then use a cross compiler
from (http://www.kegel.com/crosstool/) to compile the modified splash program.
Then use them in SE mode with -c option. I like this feature of SE mode because
you dont need to create an image with your programs. Three simple steps.
Write your c program.
Compile using the cross compiler.
Give the location of binaries as an command line argument to the SE mode.
regards,
Isuru
