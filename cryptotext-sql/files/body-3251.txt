Korey,
 
Thanks a lot! I've patched the program by using the patch you posted. Now the program is running very well on SimpleCPU. But when I change the CPU model to O3CPU there also seems only one workload has been run.
 
system = System(cpu = [DerivO3CPU(cpu_id=0,clock="1GHz"), DerivO3CPU(cpu_id=1,clock="2GHz")],              physmem = PhysicalMemory(range=AddrRange("512MB")),                membus = Bus(), mem_mode = 'timing')
Can you further check the code? I'm using M5 2.0b5 now. Thanks.

I just sent out a patch that should enforce all threads finishing before ending simulation.This hasnt been implemented as a command line option yet. I'll be doing that soon ....
Let me know if what I'm doing in the patch makes sense to people (or if I need to explain what I'm doing)....-Korey

well... it's the exit() syscall and then it's modifying theThreadContext exit() function which is called in the exit() syscall so
that it looks at the other threads in the system and and returns theright value (1?) only if it is the only thread remaining.Something like this is already done for the O3 CPU, but not forSimpleCPU as of yet (patch outstanding)...
It might be a little tricky, but definitely do-able if you need it*like now/today* instead of the pretty near future...FYI:exit syscall should be found in syscall_emul.hh/ccthread context is found in cpu/thread_context.hh
