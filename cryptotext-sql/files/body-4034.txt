Hi,
I created a disk image following the instruction of documentation. Then I ran the M5 to see if the disk image
works with other components. I booted the simulator and
type ./m5term localhost 3456 to connect the host. But
I got the following error:
.........
Warning: Unable to open an initial console.
I noticed that something called busybox is involved if using
the sample disk image. And I checked the directory my/workspace/root/dev, there is nothing but a directory ptx/.
The disk image created above is a raw image. So how to add my
own benchmark to the image? Is that right to compile my own
benchmark with alpha cross compiler(/opt/....) followed by
adding the binaries to my/workspace/root/benchmarks before
creating the disk image(ptxdist images)?
Thanks.
Xin
