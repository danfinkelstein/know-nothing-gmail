Hi, Geoffrey:
  Thanks for your advise. I have tried to build my own cross-compiler.
Now, I have my own gcc (but, no gfortran, yet). I also tried static
link in compiling cross-compiler and the benchmark binaries. However,
I still can not make SpecOMP running on M5. If I have any valuable
progress, I will post it.
regards,
  sitos
