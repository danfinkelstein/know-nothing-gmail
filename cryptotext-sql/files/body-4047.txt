I'll verify the callback queue and update you on this with new latest m5.

I used the exitcallback to register a function which is called at the end of simumations. I use floating point quantities in the simulations and wanted to print them out in my own format in a file. This function opens a file, dumps the required values into it at the end of simulation.
This is working perfectly in SE mode. But in the FS mode, there is no file being generated. The simulation ends (say when i do a ctrl-C) and dumps out the standard stats,but somehow does not call this exit function.
This is certainly odd.  There should be no difference in FS and SE mode for this stuff.
Python has an atexit handler (in src/python/m5/simulate.py) which calls internal.core.doExitCleanup upon exiting python.  That python call actually is a wrapper for the c++ function doExitCleanup in src/sim/core.cc.
I'd suggest putting a breakpoint on doExitCleanup and make sure it's actually being called.  You should also verify that the callback is indeed making it onto the callback queue.
If that doesn't get you where you need to go, I can try and see if I can reproduce the bug on my machine.
