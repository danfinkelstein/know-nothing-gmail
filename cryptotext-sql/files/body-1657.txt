You don't need to modify anything; the scons-local README is talking
to people who write the documentation for a package that uses
scons-local, not to people who would actually use it.  The only thing
you need to change is how you invoke scons; something like:
python scons.py build/ALPHA_SE/tests/debug/quick
should work, assuming you installed scons-local such that scons.py
ended up in your m5 directory.  If not, I think all you need to do is
add the path to scons.py in the command above.
