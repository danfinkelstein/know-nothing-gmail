Hi Paul,
I just put up another linux-dist.tgz where the link to the nfs-utils
tarball is from our own server - we have a copy.  the only other
difference between your tarball and the latest is the addition of a
little load-locked store-conditional test benchmark, so alternatively,
you could just change the make rules on your installation to point to:
http://www.m5sim.org/dist/m5_benchmarks/nfs-utils-1.0.6-ptx4.tar.gz
however, i'm not positive that's your problem, i remember seeing that
error before but i can't remember exactly what caused it - if you still
have a problem after you get nfs-utils into your image, write back and
attach a copy of your ptxconfig file.

I'm trying to build a image for ALPHA_FS on M5.  I've build a kernelthat boots up fine with the image provided on the M5 website.  When Ibuild my own image the kernel seems to boot, but then at the end I get this:

disabled NFS because 'nfs-utils-1.0.6-ptx4.tar.gz' could not bedownloaded.  When I googled for the file, the only place that I couldfind had it at one point, but no longer.  I'm assuming the lack of NFSis causing the problem.  Does anyone have a copy?
