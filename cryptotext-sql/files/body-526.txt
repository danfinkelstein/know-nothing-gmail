Hello,
   I am running M5 in SE mode. I have 
created a system with 3 different physical memory modules. They are laid out 
sequentially in the address space. (0-100, 101-200, etc). I want to remap pages 
between them. I have the address of a page in module 1, and I want to move it to 
another address in module 2. The data is stored in 3 different mmap'ed regions 
of the host memory. Can I simply use memcpy to transfer data or do I have to 
create packet requests and send it over the bus with write 
requests?
 
Sujay
