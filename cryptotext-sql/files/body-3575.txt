Hello all,
       I am a little 
confused about the latency and Tick units used for calculations in the dram.cc, 
using v2beta4. If I understand correctly, all dram latency parameters (like 
cas_lat) are in nanoseconds, while variables like time_since_last_access, 
currTick are of type Tick (which I assume runs at 1THz simticks 
speed).
 
So If we are using these together, shouldnt there 
be some scaling factor of 1000 in the expression. I am referring to the 
following calculations done in dram.cc:
 
...
            
overlap=(int)(busy_until[current_bank] - curTick);...
...
 
            
corrected_overlap = overlap*((int)(1/cpu_ratio)); /* floor */....
....
....
 
                            
else/*in between 
case*/                              
{                                
lat = cas_lat-corrected_overlap;
overlap and corrected_overlap are converted to 
(int) but doesnt the value still represent time in picoseconds? whereas lat is 
in nanos.
 
Or this:
----------
 total_arb_latency += 
(busy_until[current_bank] 
                                
- curTick - lat 
                                
- timing_correction); 
Again, except lat, it seems like other variables 
are all in picoseconds.
 
I would really appreciate your help on 
this.
 
Thanks,
Sujay
