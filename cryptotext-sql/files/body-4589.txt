Yes, you can use reset stats (just resets them), dumpresetstats (which dumps them to m5stats.txt, so that at the end you will have all stats from before benchmark, and another total printout of all stats after).another option is to checkpoint the processor at the end of bootup, and run from the checkpoint, so that each time you run all stats will only be from that point.

benchmark which can run on the simulator successfully by using thescripts ready for it such as modifying Benchmark.py and creating thenew .rcS for the benchmark.But I found I get a wrong timing informationbecause the 
m5stats.txt counts all the cycles since the boot up of thesystem.So I want to know how I can count the cycles just for theduration of the benchmark.I know there are some useful tools like m5reset stats, m5 dumpstats and m5 dumpresetstats,but how to use those
tools and what is the different between m5 dumpstats and m5dumpresetstats?Should I insert those commands like the following ones?/sbin/m5 resetstats/sbin/m5 dumpstats/benchmarks/benchmark
/sbin/m5 exitor /sbin/m5 dumpresetstats  /benchmarks/benchmark  /sbin/m5 exitAnother question is why there are two clocks rate for M5?One is 1THz andthe other is 2GHz.But the cycles for the system and the CPU are nearly same.
Thank you very much for your help.Best wishes to you!                           Yue Li                           04/18/2007----------------------------------------------------------------
