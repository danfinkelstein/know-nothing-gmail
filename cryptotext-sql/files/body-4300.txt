I have been debugging a bit, here are the steps I needed to take:
1. In mysql.cc, a flush() got executed during instantiation (line 470) before
the db connection was done. I fixed it like this:
--- ../m5-2.0b3-orig/src/base/stats/mysql.cc    2007-05-17 04:25:52.000000000
+0200

+        flush();
+    }
 }
2. The argument order of internal.stats.initMySQL() in src/python/m5/stats.py
was mixed up. My fix:
--- ../m5-2.0b3-orig/src/python/m5/stats.py     2007-05-17 04:25:53.000000000

3. util/stats/stats.py complained about a missing jobfile. I fixed it by a
symlink to ../batch/jobfile.pyc:
m5-2.0b3/util/stats$ ln -s ../batch/jobfile.pyc .
4. I initialized the database like this, which automatically creates a user
and the necessary databases:
util/stats/stats.py -J -h localhost -d m5 -u root -p database init
Password: <enter your MySQL root password>
This produced the following warning:
/home/jonasd/work/m5/m5-2.0b3/util/stats/dbinit.py:57:
Warning: 'TYPE=storage_engine' is deprecated; use 'ENGINE=storage_engine'
instead self.cursor.execute(sql)
I believe this is ok, but maybe it should be fixed (I didn't investigate that
yet).
Also, it took me quite some time to figure out the correct arguments for
stats.py, it is poorly documented. (-> TODO)
4.5 I added a user m5 which only has acces to the m5 database created in step
4.
5. For the simulation, I added the following to my configuration python script
(just as you said):
import m5.stats
m5.stats.initMySQL(host='localhost', database='m5', user='m5', passwd='****')
Ok, I can now tell m5 to dump the stats into a DB. I still have to figure out
how to use stats.py to generate reports etc.
