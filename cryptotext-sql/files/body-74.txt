Define "very slow" :-).  This is an instruction-level simulator, so
it's going to be a lot slower than native execution.  Mostly it
depends on how detailed your simulation model is, but at best you're
still looking at a slowdown on the order of 1000X.  That's life.

That's not how redirection works... there's no shell to interpret '>'
so you have to do it differently, using the --output option to se.py.
Run the se.py script with the --help option to see more.

That's basically a segfault in gzip, but I don't know why it would be happening.
