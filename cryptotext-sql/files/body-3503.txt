Oh, good point... my fault for trying to respond too quickly and
looking in the wrong place.  You're right, that comment explains the
point nicely, and I can see how that messes up stats.  You're also
correct that the messing up of the stats was not intentional :-).
I'll have to think about this a bit... I think the right answer is
actually to keep a bit in the tag that tracks this state, as that
would not only fix the stats but also speed up the simulation by
avoiding the expensive MSHR lookup in the common case.

The latter.
