I want to have extra bus cycles added for certain type of packets. If I add a busCycle, tickNextIdle+=clock, something anomalous happens. At one point after first 4000 cycles, the tickNextIdle gets calculated to a negative number, which the following trace on bus shows: Please suggest whats the right way to add busCycles. If I add processor cycles (tickNextIdle+=100), I dont have negative numbers but the traces show results not expected !
