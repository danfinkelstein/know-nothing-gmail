in the crosstool i built today, this was the full config file (from /opt/crosstoo/gcc-3.4.3-glibc-2.3.5/alpha-unknown-linux-gnu/alpha-unknown-linux-gnu.crosstoolconfig.txt).  it's at the bottom of the email.i rebuilt my machine lately and found that i can no longer seem to build host-util-linux, and realized it's also not necessary.  it was probably a legacy selection - and likewise for consistency's sake removed module-init-tools also, from the host-tools section of the ptxconfig.  other than that, our ptxconfigs are the same.  i built the crosstool with gcc 
4.0.4, binutils 2.17, and libc 2.4.1 on an ubuntu edgy x86 32 bit machine.  i'm just listing all my stats here so maybe it will be easier for you to find where you differ.oh yeah, also, because of my rebuild i found that the MAKEDEV script provided no longer worked on my machine, so I hacked the rules/Toplevel.make script to change the way the image and devices are created, and used the native MAKEDEV script to do so.

hey Lisa,Exactly, out of the box works.  In fact, I've been able to build disksthat have python and OpenSSH as well (needed for my application).  Butwhen I added env, it created a problem;  I worked backwards from there and
discovered that adding only env (without python and OpenSSH) wasproblematic as well, so that's when I came to the list.  So you are sayingthat you can create a disk with this ptxconfig:
