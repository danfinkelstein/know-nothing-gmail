Thanks the info, Steve.  :)
I've heard you're pretty high up in the M5 development team.  What do you think are the chances of getting "native execution" support on any platform other than x86?  And would you venture a guess as to the time frame of the x86's model/system release to the public?
Thanks.

    Nope, m5 is all straight-up C++ and Python with no host

    regression tests; just give scons this argument:
    build/SPARC_FS/tests/fast/long/80.solaris-boot/sparc/solaris/t1000-simple-atomic
    The only situation where there's any host dependence at all is
    endianness, and that's just a matter of testing.  So while both
    big- and little-endian targets work fine on little-endian hosts
    (since we do practically all our development on x86), there may be
    lurking bugs if you try and run a little-endian target on a
    big-endian host (like x86 on SPARC).  But those would be bugs and
    not design dependencies.
