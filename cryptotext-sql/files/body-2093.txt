Hello,
I am exploring the circulation of packages along the bus using the Bus
flag and some information that I am printing, and I have several
questions, I am using the detailed cpu and the configuration that
comes with the se.py file, with --caches and --l2cache options.
I am printing the origin of the cpu with  pkt->req->contextId(), and I
get outputs likes this:
CPU: 1 <-> src_port: 1, SRC: 1 DEST: -1, here we see the cpu number,
the src_port ( pkt->getSrc() ) and the destination ( pkt->getDest() )
  70000: system.membus: recvTiming: src 1 dst -1 ReadReq 0x1aa180
  70000: system.membus: The bus is now occupied from tick 70000 to 71000
CPU: 1 <-> src_port: 0, SRC: 0 DEST: 1
 100000: system.membus: recvTiming: src 0 dst 1 ReadResp 0x1aa180
 100000: system.membus: The bus is now occupied from tick 100000 to 102000
 CPU: 1 <-> src_port: 8, SRC: 8 DEST: 6
 162500: system.tol2bus: recvTiming: src 8 dst 6 ReadResp 0x1aa180
 162500: system.tol2bus: The bus is now occupied from tick 162500 to 175000
 162500: system.tol2bus: Remove retry from list 8
Can anyone tell me why for the same cpu there are several different
origin ports?, I guess is because the cpu is connected to several
buses with different ports, maybe one for the cache and another one
for the main memory, but can anyone confirm this?. but if this is
right I do not understand why if the port 1 is for the membus why I
see after port 0 also for the membus, can anyone please clarify this?.
And also is there anyway to identificate the ports?, if one is for the
cache and another one for the memory is there any way to tell wich one
is for the cache and one for the memory?.
Regarding the destination I have a similar question, is there any way
to identify id's (pkt->getDest() ) with high level information such
as, main memory, L2 cache..., thank you.
Thanks in advance.
