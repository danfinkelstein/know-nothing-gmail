Hello all,
I tried to run the testcase 01.hello-2T-smt for SPARC without
increasing the number of physical registers (in o3-timing.py script)
and I was hoping to see an assertion failure because of the following
statement in cpu.cc:
assert(params->numPhysIntRegs   >= numThreads * TheISA::NumIntRegs);
However, I get no such failure. Instead, I get this error:
"Exiting @ tick 9223372036854775807 because simulate() limit reached"
Here are the contents of simout (numThreads and TheISA::NumIntRegs are also printed out):
</fast/quick/01.hello-2T-smt/sparc/linux/o3-timing$ more simout

What am I doing wrong here?
