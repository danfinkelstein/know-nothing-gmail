I don't think it will be prevalent the way it is right now.  I think
we'll need a #define to set a namespace, something like this:
namespace THE_ISA_NAMESPACE {
// O3CPU is in the namespace so each version of the CPU model has
different symbols...
class O3CPU
{
....
};
} // end namespace
Also, I suspect we'll have to do something funky to get the #includes
right as well, though the existing arch mirroring is probably enough.
