In a previous message Steve Reinhardt mentioned that he was working on support for PARMACS/pthreads for linux in se-mode. I'd really like to take advantage of this for comparing against a complementary architecture I'm working on.
Is this functionality in any kind of a useable form? Is it something I could help with?
