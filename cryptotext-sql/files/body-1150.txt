Either InOrder or TimingCPU.O3 stands for out-of-order, so you definitely don't want that if you want an in-order core.TimingCPU is a 1CPI machine that can be attached to a timing memory model.
InOrder is new, and Korey can speak more to it, but I believe it is a mildly pipelined in-order CPU, more realistic than TimingCPU. Â However, I am not positive, nor do I know if it is really production ready - Korey?

Hi there,
To be able to perform a detailed timing on a CPU with an inorder
execution core, should I be using the DerivO3CPU model or the
InOrderCPU model?
regards,
Soumyaroop.
