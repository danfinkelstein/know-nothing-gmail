The regressions don't generally compile anything. What's happening is it's running the 00.hello regression on o3 and it's failing for some reason. Your modified CPU isn't working correctly. It's also possible to fail the regressions because you changed the cpu's behavior in a way that's still correct, but in that case it would print out a list of the statistics which are different.

i modified the 03cpu and after some further editing i was able to compile it. i was also able to run hello world or se.py on it. when i ran the regression test however
scons build/ALPHA_SE/tests/opt/quick
it returned
build/ALPHA_SE/m5.opt -d build/ALPHA_SE/tests/opt/quick/00.hello/alpha/linux/o3-timing tests/run.py quick/00.hello/alpha/linux/o3-timing > build/ALPHA_SE/tests/opt/quick/00.hello/alpha/linux/o3-timing/stdout 2> build/ALPHA_SE/tests/opt/quick/00.hello/alpha/linux/o3-timing/stderr
scons: *** [build/ALPHA_SE/tests/opt/quick/00.hello/alpha/linux/o3-timing/stdout] Error 134
scons: building terminated because of errors.
is it possible that it wouldn't compile? is this because my modified cpu is, to use a common term, unsound? or is it something else?
i thought that it'd tell me whether or not some regression tests were failed, but i didn't expect that it'd fail to compile.
thanks!
