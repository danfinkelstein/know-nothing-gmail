Hi,
        In parmacs_to_pthreads library from UPC the system call times() is used to measure time in SPLASH-2 apps.
        In Parsec 2.1/M5 , HOOKS library basically uses the system call gettimeofday() to measure time.
        Doing simple basic tests like sleep(1), it seems that both above ways return reasonable numbers. If I want to run some applications and scale number of cores is it correct to just look at the time numbers output by the applications?
        I would prefer to look at the simulator stats (ticks) and see some stat that  would be correspondent to that. So,  If I want to measure the execution time of an application just  using M5 stats, which stats should I look at? Is it "mode_ticks" for user mode ?
        Thanks for any help,
        Mario
