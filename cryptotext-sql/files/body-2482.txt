If you take a look at the flyspray bugs I posted based on this you'll see that they're still outstanding:http://www.m5sim.org/flyspray/task/317
http://www.m5sim.org/flyspray/task/318As the comments on these bug reports show, I tried a simple fix but it didn't work.  The code for deciding when you can allocate new threads on the fly in O3 is basically broken (looks like it was never tested).  At the time a general fix by anyone other than Korey looked too complicated.  I don't know if Korey's looked into it or not (Korey?).
It could be that if you don't want to use SMT then coming up with a fix that works only for the 0->1 transition might be easier, but of course a more general fix for N->N+1 would be better yet.Steve- Show quoted text -

Hi all,
So I tried to run splash benchmarks with more than 1 O3 cpu, and I get
the error message, "nxm_threade_create: no idle contexts available". It
appears that the O3CPU thread contexts are not being set to unallocated
according to some emails I saw involving Sujay Phadke. Did we ever
commit the fix to the O3CPU? If so, i don't see it.
Best,
-Rick
