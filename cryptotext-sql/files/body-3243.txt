Hi Tony,
There is a linux-patches tarball on the download page.  We've used 2.6.13, 2.6.16, 2.6.18, and 2.6.22. It's a mercurial queue that patches various versions of the linux kernel each guarded with a corresponding guard (see the mercurial queues section of the mercurial manual).

Hi,
I got M5 2.0b4   and I need to implement some thread scheduling algorithm in linux kernel
and make m5 simulator load the linux kernel to run the scheduling algorithm.
Would you please tell me which version of linux kernel m5 supports ?
How to make m5 work with the linux kernel well ?
Are there some documents ?
thanks.
