Is there a difference in the timing information of using the timing model (IE passing m5 the '-t' flag) and the O3 model (passing the '-d')?
More specifically, I noticed that Atomic uses different functions in the sending/recieving of packets. Â (IE 'snoopProbe' instead of 'snoop') Is there such a difference in O3 versus timing?
