Sorry about the delayed reply... sometimes if I don't get to an email right away I forget about it.  Feel free to repost to the list (like you did just now) if you don't get an answer within a reasonable amount of time.
The code you have below actually looks very close.  I believe the errors you are getting are simply because this line:
>     cpu.l2cache.cpu_side = cpu.toL2Bus.port
is inside the for loop instead of outside.  Since there's only one L2 cache object and one L2 bus object, you end up connecting that same L2 to the same bus N times which is what gives you all the errors.
The other confusion is that you're making the L2 cache a child of each CPU, when since there's a single shared L2 cache it really needs to be at the same level of the hierarchy as the CPUs themselves.  I think we should be able to generate a warning for this kind of error, but we don't currently.
Finally, the _mem_ports[] list is only used by the connectMemPorts() function, so setting it after you've called connectMemPorts() has no effect.
So I believe this piece of code does what you wanted your original snippet to do:
system.toL2Bus = Bus()
system.l2c = L2(size='4MB', assoc=8)
system.l2c.cpu_side = system.toL2Bus.port
for cpu in cpus:
    cpu.addPrivateSplitL1Caches(L1(size = '32kB', assoc = 1),
                                L1(size = '32kB', assoc = 4))
    cpu.connectMemPorts(system.toL2Bus)
then of course you need to connect the mem_side port of system.l2c to the main memory system, probably through another bus if you want to be able to control the bandwidth of that connection.
I haven't tested this but I think it should work.  If it doesn't work, please post your whole script so I can test it.
Actually even if it does work it would be nice if you would post it (or better yet put it on the wiki... perhaps start a page for example configuration scripts) so that Shyam has something to look at.
Sorry that responses (and progress toward the v2 release!) have been so sluggish lately... Nate & I both recently changed jobs, and the term just started back at Michigan which is tying up all the other people on the team who are still in school.  The good news is that there continues to be a lot of interest in M5 from both academia and industry so I think there will be a lot of exciting developments over the next several months.  Please bear with us, and thanks for your contributions.  We're particularly excited and grateful that people outside of our core group have been contributing answers (not just questions!) here on the list and on the wiki.  In the long run we want this to be a community thing, not just a one-way street.

Hi,
Thank you for replying. I used the example in simple-timing.pyn and it works.  My goal is to model  a combination of CMP and SMT. I'm using the ALPHA_SE for this purpose. I tried to model a system with private L1 caches and a shared L2 cache. From my understanding, the addTwoLevelCacheHierarchy adds a private L1 and a private L2 cache to a CPU, right ?   I tried to modify the code to have the L2 shared by all L1 caches as in the example that follows:
bus = Bus()
l2c = L2(size='4MB', assoc=8)
for cpu in cpus:
    cpu.addPrivateSplitL1Caches(L1(size = '32kB', assoc = 1),
                                L1(size = '32kB', assoc = 4))
    cpu.toL2Bus = bus
    cpu.connectMemPorts(cpu.toL2Bus)
    cpu.l2cache = l2c
    cpu.l2cache.cpu_side = cpu.toL2Bus.port
    cpu._mem_ports = ['l2cache.mem_side']
This is wrong as shown by the output below:
warning: overwriting port l2cache cpu_side
warning: overwriting port l2cache cpu_side
warning: overwriting port l2cache cpu_side
warning: overwriting port cpu0.l2cache mem_side
warning: overwriting port cpu0.l2cache mem_side
warning: overwriting port cpu0.l2cache mem_side
panic: Already have a mem side for this cache
 @ cycle 0
[getPort:build/ALPHA_SE/mem/cache/base_cache.cc, line 236]
Program aborted at cycle 0
Aborted
Can you give me a simple example to do that with 2 cpus, for instance ? This will probably be a good starting point to understand the interface of the python objects.
Thanks.

    Hi Alain,
    Did you apply the 2.0beta1 patch "Patch 1" from the web site
    (http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Download)?  I believe it fixes
    this
    problem.  If not, please repost to the list.
    An example of a config file with a two-level cache hierarchy is in
    tests/configs/simple-timing.py.
