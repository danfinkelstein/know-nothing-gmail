Hi,
I am trying to synchronize two processors in AtomicSimpleCPU. Say I have two
CPUS, cpu0 and cpu1, and they are assigned the same testcase so that they run
in parallel. I set up my fetch stage so that cpu0 gets the first instruction
and cpu1 gets the next instruction. Their register files cannot communicate
with each other, so I declared a static struct where both cpus can see and
access it and thus update their register files whenever either one updates
their own. I tried to implement synchronization using locks and spins.
In my hello world testcase, cpu1's thread arrives earlier than cpu0 at the start
(which is normal), but it just spins forever. Somehow, cpu0's thread never comes
and does its thing and unlock it. This sounds like threads are not
issued/executed in parallel or independently of one another. What am I missing
or what should I do to make them synchronize?
Thanks,
Christopher
