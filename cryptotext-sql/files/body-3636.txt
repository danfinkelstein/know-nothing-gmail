 Hi everybody,
   I know this email seems a little off-topic but has anyone here tried porting a Basic Block Vector Generator in M5 for use in Simpoints? Would appreciate if you can provide diff files. Also, If I use the BBV generator from SimpleScalar(sim-fast)[1] will I get the same results(since it has been said in the documentation that M5 is based on SimpleScalar,and also considering I use the ALPHA ISA)?
thanks,
-dean
