> as i understand it, a tick is equivalent to a clock cycle in m5.
yes and no.  A tick is equal to a cycle but every component isnt run at the same
frequency so you cant assume they all even out perfectly.
The tick is based off the global system frequency/clock that is defined
in configs/common/Simulation.py
I think that's set to '1ps' per tick by default.
Then, your CPU is based on a certain clock, which I think is by
default "2 GHz".
Thus, one cpu cycle is worth X (500?) amount of system ticks. That is
what you are
going to see when you see your simulation output and it tells you how
many system
cycles/ticks you spent.

In the actual CPU code, yes it is trying to fetch a cache line once per tick,
but take not that is once per CPU tick not system tick.

No, the # of instructions fetched per cycle is an CPU parameter.
Remember, that fetch fetches a
cache line, but a cache line could have multiple instructions in it
that can be "fetched".

Close but not really. The DynInst encapsulates the static inst object.
Check out the WIKI pages on static and dyninst and let us know if
things make sense:
http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/StaticInst
http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/DynInst
Hope that helped clear things up. Please feel free to look at the
documenation though as
we always strive to make those documents as clear as possible for
users. It's important
that people can look at that and have a general idea of things. If you
see something that
needs changing, it's a WIKI so you can change it or bring it to the
community's attention
for a potential change...
Good luck with your work!
