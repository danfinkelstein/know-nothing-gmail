Hi Meng yes I got my config.ini, the problem was that M5 couldn't write in /tmp/output and it didn't say anything, I just changed the directory to a local one and everything was fine, thank you again.- Show quoted text -

Hi Eduardo,Do you have the config.ini in the /tmp/output ? I use your command,and it's fine in my M5. I have the correct outputs in the /tmp/output.
I think you can try:(1) Remove the "-d /tmp/output" from command line. The M5 will writethe config.ini and m5stats.txt directly into your work directory.(2) Do you have enough quota on your file system?
