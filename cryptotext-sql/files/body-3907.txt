Thanks Steve !
1.
In the first case, I am actually running four copies of radix each on one of the four processors. Basically I want to run different applications each on four processors. Apart from segemntation fault, another problem is as soon as one of the processes finishes, the simulation comes to a hault. Is it how the simulator is supposed to be?
2.
If I make a single LiveProcess() with radix for instance, and assign it as workload to all four processors, does the four processors actually run different thread of the same process. Because, in the final statistics I only see the results for one of the four processors which sounds as if only one of them was running thr process.
