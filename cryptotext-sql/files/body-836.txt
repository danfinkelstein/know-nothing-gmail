Based on the results I am getting, for PARSEC benchmarks, the OoO
preformance is really bad, there are to many hw_mfpr and hw_mtpr,
instructions. I am trying to figure out why I am in the PALcode so
often (any ideas on how to figure this out?). I am running
Blackscholes, which is a relatively simple PARSEC benchmark.
I need to do more research, but I dont think this is caused at all for
itb and dtb misses (i made them really large just in case).
Right now for blackscholes, which isnt close to finish executing
(about 30%) I have it so it will execute  1e9 instructions (running
two cores),  From my perl scripts it seems to have it fetched 13
million hw_mfpr and mtpr instructions (fetched, not committed). There
is something really wrong with that ratio.
Thanks,
EF
