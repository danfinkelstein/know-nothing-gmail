Hey all,
 
I’m trying to follow the splash2 example to create
threads in SE mode. However, I found that the crosstool only cross compiles
code on linux, while the precompiled splash2 uses tru64. While the system call
for creating thread is emulated for tru64, the system call is not emulated for
linux (in the source code, the system call associated with “fork”
is “unimplemented”).  So, I wonder how the splash2 precompiled
binary is built. Are they built in a real environment? Or what crosscompiler is
available to compile code for tru64, so that I can use the implemented emulation?
 
I would also be happy if there are other ways to emulate
threads in SE mode with linux binary.
 
Thanks!
