It looks like you're using an old version... you should upgrade to
2.0b4.  The bus code is somewhat cleaned up.  In particular there's no
SNOOP_COMMIT flag anymore.

Yes.

Can you give some examples?

Can you be more specific?  Packets are already delayed if necessary
due to earlier bus traffic; that's what tickNextIdle is all about.
