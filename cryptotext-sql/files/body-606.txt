Folks,
I had been working on m5-2.0b6 with 4 cores/2threads and what I found is
that it would never complete even after months (runaway).
I downloaded and compiled the later versions and then for some reason
any attempt at running the benchmarks wouldn't work.
So my questions are:
1. Is there a resolution to the runaway problem?
2. What are the steps to transition from m5-2.0b6 to newer versions?
3. A colleague said we need to recompile the benchmarks for the newer
version, is that so?
(also does anyone have a copy handy of the config/alpha.cfg ?)
