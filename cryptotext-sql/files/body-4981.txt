Hi,  Thanks alot for the help. Your examples for the benchmarks really helped me and as it turned out I really was giving the wrong input and was able to fix them.  Now most of the benchmarks are running but I have two questions:  1) I am running for 50000000 instructions for four CPUs.. My command line is  SimpleCPU.max_insts_all_threads = 50000000  When any one of the CPU reaches this count, it exits causing other CPUs to exit as well whether or not they have reached this. Is this how its supposed to be?   2) Secondly, how can I see the error messages of the Benchmarks?   Thanks again for the help,  Sincerely,  Bushra Ahsan- Show quoted text -    James Srinivasan <James.Srinivasan@cl.cam.ac.uk> wrote: > Wow, this is all stuff that should buffed a bit and

I'm sure Ken would be willing to have his stuff posted.I would have posted my Benchmarks.py file on the wiki but I'm not 100%sure it'll work with m5 v2 without changes. As far as I'm concerned itcan be used however anyone sees fit. It could do with more (some) errorchecking and maybe a little more configurability. Unfortunately I have alooming thesis deadline and it works well enough for my purposes so I'mnot really able to spend much time tinkering.
