I just realized I created a ConstVectorNode back in the spring but never
sent out the diff of statistics.hh.  Here it is.  Better late than never I
guess...
For sure.
Note that this diff includes two separate changes to statistics.hh:  the
ConstVectorNode, and the fix to the BinaryNode total() function (that was
also discussed on the list at around the same time).  Also note that this is
a diff from statistics.hh in m5-2.0b2; I know there were some changes in
this file in m5-2.0b3, but I haven't yet made the switch (sorry about
that).  Hopefully that won't be too much of an impediment.
There have not been many changes (at least committed ones) to the stats package in some time, so it applied fine.
The fix to the total() function had already been committed.
Do you mind if I put your name and e-mail message into the commit log for the vector node patch?  (I'd prefer the committer of record for any patch to be the person who came up with the patch.)
