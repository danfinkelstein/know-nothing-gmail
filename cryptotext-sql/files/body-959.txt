Hi,
I am new to M5 and want to explore M5 with DRAMSim. I saw Clint's post
with a patch.
http://m5sim.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/m5-users/2009-January/004014.html
Am wondering if the patch is still available in the repositary. I did
not see [mq] in the message.
Pardon my ignorance, I am completely new to Mercury and don't know
what's required to get the patch. But searching the patches on the
repository did not
show the patch anymore either.
http://repo.m5sim.org/m5/log?rev=dram
Could anybody point me to where and how to get your patches?
Thanks a lot for your help in advance.
Best regards,
john
