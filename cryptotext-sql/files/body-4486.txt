I'm not sure why exactly this is happening, but it might be a related scons bug.
We'll need to see if we can find a workaround and get the scons guys to fix the problem.- Show quoted text -

I followed the wiki instructions. It seems that CPU_MODELS defaults to ALL for ALPHA_FS (Which has to be manually changed everytime to "ALL" when using the latest version of scons...).
Anyway, I replaced ALL with 'AtomicSimpleCPU,O3CPU,TimingSimpleCPU' as is the default case with ALPHA_SE and it compiled with no problems.
Thanks for your help,

Did you tell it to compile the FullCPU?  That cpu model has not worked in quite some time.  You would have had to change the CPU_MODELS flags to get it to compile.  Try building the default and it should work.
Perhaps we shouldn't have released a known broken CPU model, but it's really just there for historical purposes.

I am just starting using m5 and I have downloaded the v2 beta3 sources from the site. I have successfully compiled and run the tests for ALPHA_SE, but I have some compilation errors when trying to compile the FS version. Namely the compiler is complaining about not finding the files "encumbered/cpu/full/op_class.hh" and "mem/functional/functional.hh". In fact there is no "mem/functional" folder in the source files at all.
I am attaching a file with all the compiler errors I am given.
Any ideas?
Thanks in advance,
Nikolas
