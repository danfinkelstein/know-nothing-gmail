Ah, had no idea, I'll look into using the default python then. Thanks!

If you're on a 64bit capable OS X host the configure script assumes that you want to compile a 64bit binary. Unfortunately macports doesn't (at least not easily) compile 64 bit binaries or fat binaries. So if you're using the macports version of python that won't work for a 64bit compile. However, the version of Python that comes with 10.5 has libraries that are fat (32 & 64 bit), so you can compile a 64 bit binary. The speed of the 64 bit m5 binaries is drastic enough that I deal with the hassle, but perhaps we need a more elegant solution.

Using the normal SConstruct, it is unable to find my Python.h file (located in /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/include/python2.4), despite appearing to check the correct directory. The following error message is printed:
Checking for C header file Python.h... no
Error: can't find Python.h header in /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/include/python2.4
Looking into the SConstruct, I found that in b5 some 64bit compilation option was added ("-arch x86_64"). When I comment out the appends done to the environment variables (starting at line 396), I am once again able to build the simulator without error.
I'm not familiar enough with SCons to know if there is a bug in this code, but this may be an issue.
Not sure if it matters but I'm using OSX 10.5 on a core 2 duo.
