Hello,
I'm experiencing a problem in using the Fast forwarding option of M5.
Currently I'm using the InOrderCPU of ALPHA_SE in the dev branch (last
updated a couple of weeks ago).
Is there anybody else who had problems switching cpu's that use caches?
The problem occurs in 2 different ways:
1)When I try adding L1 caches and an L2 cache to my system:
-I connect my Detailed cpu to the L2Bus and the L2 cache to the membus
and L2Bus
-I connect my Atomic cpu to the membus
The error message is:
info: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...
panic: AtomicSimpleCPU doesn't expect recvTiming callback!
  @ cycle 6000
[recvTiming:build/ALPHA_SE/cpu/simple/atomic.cc, line 107]
So the Atomic CPU can't even execute normaly.
However in case 2 it's the Detailed cpu that gets the problem
2)When I try adding a (splitted) L1 cache to my system:
-I connect my Detailed cpu to the membus
-I connect my Atomic cpu to the membus
The error message is:
Switched CPUS @ cycle = 154500
Changing memory mode to timing
switching cpus
panic: Unimplemented!
  @ cycle 154500
[takeOverFrom:build/ALPHA_SE/sim/sim_object.cc, line 257]
Am I doing something very stupid? Or does someone has an idea what could
be the problem?
I can send you my config-file..
Thanks,
Max
