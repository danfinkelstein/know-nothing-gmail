If you want to trace the behavior of O3 itself, it has a number of trace
flags and there's one that turns them all on called O3CPUAll. You can
see where they're declared in src/cpu/o3/SConscript. O3CPUAll will
generate a LOT of output, so use it carefully.
If you want to trace execution, instruction tracing has historically
just been controlled by DPRINTFs and by the way you've compiled the
simulator (so don't use m5.fast, I think). That system works essentially
the same in all CPU models.
A while ago I turned the instruction tracer into a changable SimObject
so you could, for instance, used a different format needed by some other
tool, communicate register state to some other program to verify, etc.
The IntelTrace object you're looking at is one of the alternative
instruction tracers, written by Lisa for use with an Intel tool of some
sort. It predates my change and was orignally controlled directly with
traceflags. I may have mangled it in translation, but I expect I would
have tested it at least a little. Anyway, as long as you haven't
explicitly changed anything, the original tracer is installed by default
and behaves pretty much like it always has, controlled by traceflags. To
get a normal trace just turn on the Exec traceflag.
