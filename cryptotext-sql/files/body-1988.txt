The configs/splash2 script is only for SE mode, not FS mode.  If you want to run programs in FS mode, you first must load them onto a disk image where the simulated OS can find them.  You should be able to find more guidance on the wiki and in the mailing list archives for this.  Feel free to ask the list if you have specific problems that you can't find answers to elsewhere.
