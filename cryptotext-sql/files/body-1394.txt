Not everywhere, but most places. The bus uses the port interface
directly without the SimpleTimingPort, however it doesn't derive from
port.  I'm not sure what a more detailed interface that derived from
Port would look like. If you assume that the device that uses the
SimpleTimingPort handles requests serially this model is fine, the
only issue is when there is contention within a device. If you read
the page on the wiki about the memory interface the port class
provides primitives for a more detailed implementation.
