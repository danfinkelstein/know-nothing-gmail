Hello,
    If I have an occupancy stat declared as an average. This is
incremented or decremented based on the number of objects in my queue.
however, the objects in this queue will be carried over between
switching cpus. Now if I call m5.stats.reset() between switching from
timing to detailed say, is it possible to prevent this stat from being
reset? Because if I am maintaining the objects in this queue, resetting
this stat will
 be incorrect. Please correct me if i am wrong.
Sujay
