Hi all,
We have some general questions on the flexibility of M5:
How flexible is the simple-core model?  For example, how to extend it to
support vector insts? I know we need to add new instructions, but since we
will add new vector registers, how will this affect the decoder, the ISA
parser, and the CPU?
Just want to make sure: can we compose different cores in one simulation, to
do a heterogeneous processor? Say, with one O3 CPU and several simple cpus?
(I assume O3 and TimingSimpleCPU can coexist?)
Thanks!
Jiayuan
