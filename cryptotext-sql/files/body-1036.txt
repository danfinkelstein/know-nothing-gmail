Hello,
Is there some way to get the simulator to call the destructors of the
components in the test system (FS mode) or to receive an event signaling
that the simulation is exiting? I've tried adding print statements all
the way up the inheritance chain (starting with PhysicalMemory in my
case) and none seem to be called. I also did a leak check using valgrind
and this is confirmed (lots of data still in use at termination).
Essentially I have some compressed output streams that need to be
flushed and closed at the end of simulation and I can't make them
globals to ensure they are closed at termination. Thanks for any help.
