The modprobe errors can come from many things and normally are pretty
benign. Are you compiling the binary using an osf/1 compiler. If are are
there are two options:
1) Compile the binary for Linux/Alpha
2) Recompile the kernel with the osf/1 compatibility enabled
what happens if you run: file /bin/scatter (can be done on the system you
compiled on)?
