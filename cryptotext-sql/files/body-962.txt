- Show quoted text -Hi I am trying to simulate two experiments dealing with multi-core multi-threaded system. Say case is 2 core X 2 thread. So there are 4 benchmarks used. I am using following SPEC CPU 2000 benchmarks: swim, lucas, equake, fma3d. I have also setup the early simpoint values for each for them ( 5, 35, 194, 298 respectively) . 
Now I am running three simulations with max_insts_all_thread = 100M:case (0) when all benchmarks have simpoint values 0.case (1) When benchmarks are used in following order with their early simpoint values
system.cpu[0].workload = Benchmarks.SPECSWIM() (500,000,000), Benchmarks.SPECFMA3D() (29,800,000,000)system.cpu[1].workload = Benchmarks.SPECEQUAKE()(19,400,000,000), Benchmarks.SPECART() (3,500,000,000)
case (2) When benchmarks are used in with their early simpoint values while inter-changing the benchmarks for cpu [0].system.cpu[0].workload = Benchmarks.SPECFMA3D() (29,800,000,000), Benchmarks.SPECSWIM() (500,000,000)
system.cpu[1].workload = Benchmarks.SPECEQUAKE()(19,400,000,000), Benchmarks.SPECART() (3,500,000,000)I have compared the simulations stats on m5stats file. The case (0) and case (2) produces no differences in the statistics in the stats file. But the case (1) produces the difference in the statistics. Why this happens??
