I have traced through on an error I was getting. The assertion says the following:
        void Cache<TagStore>::handleResponse(Packet*) [with TagStore = LRU]:
                Assertion `target->pkt->cmd == MemCmd::ReadResp' failed.
I annotated the Cache trace printout to display what command the packet his right before that assertion and the one causing the error is a LoadLockedResp. Given that a LoadLockedResp is both an IsRead and an IsResponse, I was wondering if it was safe to modify the assertion to allow LoadLockedResp's as well, or if this would have other unintended side-effects.
Thanks,
