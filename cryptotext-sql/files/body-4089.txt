Hello,
I am getting a simliar error as this person below but I am not
starting from a check point but rather just starting at the beginning
of the simulation.  I get the following error.  The input is also show
below.  I am not sure of the memory size of the machine I am running
it on.  Could this could be what's preventing the running of the
program.  What else could be the issue that is causing this MMAP to
return a fatal error?
Thanks,
Aaron
