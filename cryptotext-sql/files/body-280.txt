sim_insts, sim_second, sim_freq, host_inst_rate, host_mem_usage,
host_seconds, and host_tick_rate are all special stats in that they
reflect parameters about the simulator itself and the host, not the
simulated program.  None get reset.  That could be changed by adding a
bit of code.  See src/sim/stat_control.cc
