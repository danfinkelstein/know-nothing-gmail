Good question... it's not clear they need to be.  I think the overall
motivation is to make sure that lock acquire/release operations are
properly ordered, but for Alpha that should be enforced via separate
barrier instructions anyway.  I assume this is happening as a side
effect of the instructions being marked as "locked"?  Can you point to
the code you're referring to?
