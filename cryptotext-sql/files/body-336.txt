Hi, The functions defined in util/m5(quiesce, arm etc) also seem to be defined in pseudo_inst.cc files in the /src/sim folder. Do the new instructions have to be defined in both the places? Also if we define these instructions, we need to get our benchmark compiled for an assembly code which will include these new instructions. 
Soumyaroop has suggested that we need to change the binutils folder in the crosscompiler, but we havent been able to find the specific alpha patches in any of the versions of binutils. Which version contains the alpha match that needs to be modified?

If the instructions aren't absolutely performance critical, it's
easier to put them in a separate .s file in functions and just call
the functions. Â See how the m5-specific instructions are done in
util/m5.
