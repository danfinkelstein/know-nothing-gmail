Dear m5 users and developers,
I have a few questions about the M5's current capabilities:
1. The FAQ section
(http://m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_run_multiprogram_workloads_on_M5.3F)
says:
"Note that SE mode has no thread scheduling; if you need a scheduler,
run in FS mode and use the fine scheduler built into the Linux
kernel."
This is not talking about the thread scheduler in the processor core
that picks up instructions from various threads during the
instructions fetch stage, is it?
2. If my understanding above is correct and if I were to model SMT
capabilities of a single core of the OpenSparc T1, I may build the
simulator for Sparc in SE mode. Otherwise, I will have to build the
same in FS mode. Is this correct?
3. I also found out from the m5-users archive
(http://www.mail-archive.com/m5-users@m5sim.org/msg02138.html) that
the Sparc support in FS mode is not as mature as Alpha support in FS
mode. Is it a better idea to model a generic SMT and/or CMP processor
on the Alpha processor instead of the Sparc processor from the
perspective of not running into simulator limitations?
4. The M5 documentation
(http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) mentions that the
Alpha support in M5 is modeled on a DEC Tsunami system. Is that a CMP
processor (corresponding to Opensparc T1 for Sparc)? I could not find
a manual for it.
5. Is it possible to simulate both SMT and CMP capabilities in M5?
regards,
Soumyaroop.
