Statistics are dumped to the file right before m5 exits with a python
exit handler. What status does m5 exit with (type echo $? <enter>
immediately after m5 ends)?  If you set a break point on
'Stats::dump()' does it get reached? What if you don't use -d? Does an
m5stats.txt appear in the directory you're running m5 from. Does it
have any statistics in it?
