Hi Jibang,For questions 1 and 2, see here:http://m5.eecs.umich.edu/wiki/index.php/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_many_CPUs_can_M5_run.3F
you will just need to download the appropriate palcode and apply our linux patches and recompile for a >4 cpu platform.  if you don't want to build your own crosstool, you can download one on our download page for the recompilation.
For question 3, if all you want is a larger disk image, there are simpler ways to do it, see here:http://m5.eecs.umich.edu/wiki/index.php/Frequently_Asked_Questions#What_if_I_need_more_space_than_is_available_on_the_disk_image.3F
#1 is in my opinion the easiest way to get a larger image.Good luck.Lisa- Show quoted text -On Wed, Jun 18, 2008 at 3:44 PM, Jibang Liu <iamjbliu@gmail.com> wrote:
Hi all
I have several questions, can you give me some ideas?
1) The sampled vmlinux downloaded from m5 website is only suitable for
the case which has less than 4 cpu. Is this right?
2) If I hope the number of CPU is more than 4, I need to recompile the
linux kernel instead of the sampled vmlinux. In this case how can I do
it? Or there is such new kernel we can download from m5 website?
3) When I'm trying create a bigger image disk,I do it following the
instruction "Compiling benchmarks for the image and creating the image
with linux-dist". But I meet an error as following, how can I fix it?
