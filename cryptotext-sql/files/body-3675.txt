The key difference with TimingSimpleCPU is that all memory operations
are two phase (the CPU initiates them and then they're completed in a
callback from the memory system).  Instructions are executed when the
instruction fetch completes, in completeIfetch.  Non-memory
instructions are executed by calling curStaticInst->execute().  Memory
instructions are initiated via curStaticInst->initiateAcc() and
complete in completeDataAccess().

gtoh is "guest-to-host" endian conversion... all that line does is a
byte swap if needed.  The comment refers to the next 45 or so lines of
code, not just that function.
BTW, you might want to try "cscope" for looking up function
definitions like gtoh... http://cscope.sourceforge.net.  There's a
cscope-index.py script in util that autmatically builds a cscope index
for m5.
