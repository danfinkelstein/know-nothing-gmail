    If you want to know about all of the instructions that are being
executed, you can add --trace-flag=InstExec to your command line after
the m5 binary and before the configuration script. That will print the
disassembly for each instruction as it executes, as well as some other
information including the tick. If you want to change the code that's
executed for a particular instruction, to, for instance, print out a
message showing the current tick (curTick), you should look in
src/arch/alpha/isa/decoder.isa, assuming you're using Alpha. That file,
like everything else in the "isa" directory, is written in a custom
language designed for describing ISAs in m5. You should be able to add a
print statement there without too much trouble.
