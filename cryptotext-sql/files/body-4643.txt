Hi,
I am using the DetailedCPU model and v1.1. How can I use the Sampler for switching between the Simple and detailed?
Thanks,

Hi,
I have been trying to bring up a 4-CMP Full System setup, giving a Memory configuration of "OCM".
It has been more than 2 hours and the Linux kernel has still not finished booting up. Is it usual for it to take so long, as it seems quite weird.
Thanks,
Meeta
