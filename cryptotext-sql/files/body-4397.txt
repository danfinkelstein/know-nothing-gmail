Never mind. I am able to solve the
problem.

Subject: [m5-users] adding a new
device at a pio_address. 
 
Hi,
 
I am attempting to add a
new device to the full system mode. But during initialization, src/mem/bus.cc
Bus::recvStatusChange(Port::Status status, int id) is called which sets the
portId for all device ranges in portList (including the new one) to 0. The
result is that memory receives pio access, because src/mem/bus.cc will
recognize the address range, but the portId is now zero which is physical
memory. The new pio_address is beyond physical memory so it is not clear why
the memory is being assigned as the device for all pio accesses. Any thoughts
would be helpful.
 
Thanks,
Richard.
