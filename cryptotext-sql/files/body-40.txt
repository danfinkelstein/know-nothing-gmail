Hi all,
I'm trying to run selected benchmarks from MiBench in M5. The system is configured into multi-core (CMP) mode with each core has its own L1 caches and all cores share a unified L2 cache. Each core is assigned a different benchmark. However, I found the following error:
When I use the L1 cache configuration of (32kB, 2 assoc, 32B) and L2 of (4MB, 8 assoc, 64B), which are the default values, everything is OK. However, when I try to change the cache configuration, for example, L1 with a size of 8kB and L2 with 128kB or L1 with 16kB and L2 with 1MB, the simulation terminates with the error:
0: system.remote_gdb.listener: listening for remote gdb on port 7000
0: system.remote_gdb.listener: listening for remote gdb on port 7001
panic: Tried to execute unmapped address 0.

Am I missing something?
Thanks.
