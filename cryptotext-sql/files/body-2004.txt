Hi,
First, some important concepts about simpoints. The use of simpoints is
dependent on the binary you are running. Depending on how your Spec2K
benchmarks were compiled (optimization level) and for what operating
system (OSF vs Linux), the location of the simpoints can change. The
first thing you need to do is run simpoint analysis on your benchmarks
to find the correct location for the simulation. Make sure you
accurately account for whether your simpoint location accounts for
no-ops or not as this can effect the absolute location in the binary.
Once you know the correct simpoint location, you should modify the
simpoints counts in cpu2000.py
To directly answer your question, you will know that the thread has
reached it fastforward location because the simulator will have an exit
event of "a thread reached the max instruction count" in
configs/common/Simulation.py (assuming you did not add a second max
instruction count event). You could add an explicit M5 dump stats
command at this point if you wanted to verify the instruction count
(which will presumably be the top entry of stats in your m5stats.txt file).
If you want more help with how to use this feature, look through the
mailing list for "simpoint" and you find the development decisions and
examples that were posted to the m5 community.
Best,
