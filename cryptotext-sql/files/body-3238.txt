Thank you very much for your kindly reply.
I use Valgrind to check the memory leakage of 410.bwaves on Pentium4.
I use the test dataset. The program allocates 163 Mbytes, and it has
no memory leakage.
malloc/free: 355 allocs, 355 frees, 163,570,613 bytes allocated.
I tried to run the alpha binary on M5.  M5 used  whole memory (2G
physical memory +  2G swap) and it was killed by the system. What
should I do to identify the cause of this problem?
thanks
