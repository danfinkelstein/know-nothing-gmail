There are first some legal issues that I'm working on to get HP to
release the x86 code (since it was mostly developed at HP).  It's not
clear how long that will take.  The answer from the lawyers could be
no in which case it will take a while to argue, but I'm hopeful that
we'll have a positive answer in a small number of weeks.  As for Xen,
that more or less requires full-system support and Gabe is a better
person to comment on that part.
