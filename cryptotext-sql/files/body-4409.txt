Matt,
Yes, there already is a simple TM model which is based on LogTM from UWisc
working in M5. But it has not been merged into the main releases.  I'm
currently the only student working on it, so progress has been slow, but
steady.
I would be interested in some collaborative efforts to help maintain better
support for what I have so far.  What models for TM were you interested in?
I can't see any potential problems as of yet with considering a
collaborative effort.
You can reach me at blakeg@umich.edu if you would like to talk more.
Thanks
Geoff

Subject: [m5-users] Transactional Memory support in M5
Hi,
I've got a few quick questions about M5 and Transactional Memory, and
would really appreciate any answers from the M5 community.
* Are there any efforts underway to support TM in M5?
* Would anyone else be interested in starting some form of collaborative
effort to bring some of the TM models to M5?
* Can anyone foresee any potential problems/issues/blocks to pursuing
such an effort?
Thanks,
