Hi,
 
I’m using M5 1.1, I wonder whether I can run surge
specweb which is originally included in the system. I don’t have the specweb
image file since it is not distributed anymore. I wonder whether I can get the reasonable
result if I simply run surge specweb without the image file. If it does not give
the correct result, I would like to run specweb2005 I owned. However, I’m
not quite familiar with cross compiling, and I only have the binary of specweb2005.
Could you help to cross compile it, which is based on Java.
 
Thanks a lot.
Yu
