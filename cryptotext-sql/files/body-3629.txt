I’d suggest taking a look at src/mem/bus.hh,src/mem/bus.cc,src/mem/cache/cache_impl.hh
and src/mem/cache/miss/mshr.cc to gain an understanding on how coherence and
the bus interconnect work with each other.  If you want to implement a
different type of interconnect, like a mesh, then you will have to modify the
coherence scheme as well as the interconnect.

Thanks for the reply.
Furthermore, if I want to use other interconnection network topologies in M5,
is there a quick way to get start?
Thanks,
Yu

The interconnection between
cpus that M5 currently uses is a snoopy bus.  Unfortunately, there is no
other way to interconnect CPUs.  Though as of M52.0b4, you can construct a
hierarchal bus structure, ie: 4 CPUs, each pair of cpus shares an L2, and coherence
is done among the local and remote pair, similar to how an Intel quad core is
setup.  (Someone please correct me if this not correct.)

Subject: [m5-users] Interconnection between multiple processors
 
Hi,
I want use the full system mode booting with multiple processors to run some
MPI programs. I was wondering how the processors are connected to each other.
Since in the configuration, the only thing I could do is to set the number of
cpus. Is there a default interconnection network between these cpus? Or there
is no interconnection at all but only a shared memory? I want to know how the
cpus communicate with each other and how I can get control of the
communication. 
Thanks,
Yu
