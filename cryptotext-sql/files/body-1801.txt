Hello Clint, thanks for your answer and for your advice of using the priority as a way to identify the cores, it is a good idea.
 
I hope you can help me. I have been looking through the code about the policies trying to do what I am looking for, but the code is a little complex. Do you know if FCFS serves the first command that finds in the biu?. The reason to ask this, is that reordering the biu according to my policy is very simple, I am thinking that if I can reorder the biu and if FCFS take the first command, in this way is easy to do what I am trying to do. I just put in the first position of the biu an access of core x, and that's all.
 
Regarding the statistics, is there any stat related with the hits and the misses?, I am printing the stats, with  mem_print_stat(...) but I do not see any parameter to print the hits and miss in the memory. Do you know any parameter to print that information?. Thank you.
 
Thanks a lot for your help, it is really appreciable.

Ah, I see what you are saying, but that functionality actually resides within DRAMsim itself. The doTiming method of the DRAMsim M5 object can take as many packets as the network can give it, but it simply finds a free slot in the BIU and places it there for DRAMsim to process on the next memory controller cycle. On line 240, you will see the priority variable which is constantly set to zero. According to the DRAMsim code, that is intended for a purpose such as you are looking for, but I don't believe it does the correct thing right now. If you have the priority field set based on the core number, and then you modify/create a policy to do as you want within DRAMsim, you should be able to get the desired behavior.
The biggest issue you may face is the fact that to actually make the system work, you would have to have requests arrive at (nearly) the same time. If the memory controller is connected to a bus, this is not possible, which would skew the results. If the pressure on the memory system is high enough, then it would be possible to see the selection policy in action, but it is more difficult to guarantee.
Hopefully this information helps.

Hello Clint thanks a lot for the patch. I have been testing it and it seems that works fine. Thanks a lot. I have a question regarding the reordering of the accesses. Do the selection policies Greedy, FCFS... work?. What I mean is that when there are several accesses at the *same* time all the accesses are stored inside of the transaction queue in DRAMSim? or on the contrary the accesses are sent one by one to DRAMSim (then DRAMSim process the petition and send the answer, in this case DRAMSim works as FCFS). In this last case then they are stored in the retry list in the bus.cc file. My interest for this is to give some priorities for accesses from some cores, that's why I am asking this, because I want to know who stores the petition, to reorder them there. I hope you knwo what I mean if not please let me know. Thanks a lot in advance. > Date: Fri, 23 Jan 2009 12:41:10 -0500> From: cws3k@cs.virginia.edu> To: m5-users@m5sim.org> Subject: [m5-users] [PATCH] Beta patch for M5 2.0 DRAMsim implemention> > # HG changeset patch> # User Clint Smullen <cws3k@cs.virginia.edu>> # Date 1232732406 18000> # Node ID a95dd3a28ecb82a074de030367fe641d52aaf148> # Parent 0397aa216e2290a50fb7138bd28563926573c929> Beta patch for M5 2.0 DRAMsim implemention.
