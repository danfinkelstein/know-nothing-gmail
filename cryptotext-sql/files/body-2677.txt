Hi Nate,
     Thanks for replying. Well for the present I am using hg itself and
making my own changes to the source. I commit them using hg commit. I have a
custom emacs merge file which makes merging easy in case the source repo
changes. I think this works good for now. I do fold the changes back using
hg. I really didnt hear back from anyone about their experience so I dont
know if taking the mq approach is better.
