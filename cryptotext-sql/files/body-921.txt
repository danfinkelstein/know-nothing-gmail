Hi all,
I am a freshman with M5. My problem is how to use M5 to get profiling
information. What is the command and options to start profiling? And how to
collect the profiling informations?
Do I have to use build/ALPHA_FS/m5.prof instead of build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt to
get start the M5?
Thanks & Regards
hyacinth
