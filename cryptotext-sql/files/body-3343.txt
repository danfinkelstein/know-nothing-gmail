Sorry, I misread that. Yea, one DynInst contains one StaticInst.
Again, very sorry about the misread on my part.

It means that the CPU tries to fetch one cache line per tick and tries
to get a N number of instructions from that cache line based on some parameter.

Whatever the "width" parameter (I believe thats what it is called) is,
is the # of
instructions that can be passed from one stage to another any given cycle.
However, in between some stages are skidBuffers in order to ease stage
pressure a bit
in the presence of stalls.
