I think that our PCI model is relatively reasonable.  It doesn't model
the low level pci timing, but you do give busses a width and a
frequency, so you are able to control bandwidth and latency.  I'm
pretty certain that the IDE controller's timing model is pretty
minimal and in fact, the bandwidth between the ide controller and the
disk may not be constrained properly.  That said, as long as you get
that bandwidth correct, I doubt that timing within an IDE controller
will affect the disk much.  I could see you needing to do more stuff
if you want to support tagged queuing properly, I'm not sure.  I think
your only real risk is the IDE controller, but to be honest, I don't
see you getting something better anywhere else.
