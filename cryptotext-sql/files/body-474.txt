Hello,
I am running a program where I noticed that 50% of M5 execution time is spent in the kernel. Looking at the program, I cannot find reasons why this would be the case (4 threads, where there is very little communcation between threads). Anyone have any idea on how to trace the instruction callsys,and see what system calls are made?
 
I see a huge amount of callsys, swpipl, rti instructions being executed!
 
 
Thanks,
EF
