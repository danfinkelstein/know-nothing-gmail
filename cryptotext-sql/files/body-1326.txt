If you must do FS, then you can run a multi-threaded program on a CMP rather than an SMT platform.  You can use the set_affinity syscall to attach a particular thread to a particular core.  Search the archives, I'm sure it has been discussed before on the mailing list.

Thanks, Korey. But I must run my program on FS mode, some of my testbenches fail to run on SE mode. 
 
Maybe running a multi-thread program on a single cpu core is my only choice, but how to dinstinguish them against each other? Do you have any idea about that? I think M5 run only one thread on one cpu core at a time, as all the thread ID are 0. 
 
> Hi all, does M5 support SMT system?Yes, you can run SMT in SE mode. Currently, more SMT regressions are
being added to ensure functionality across the board. Check "se.py"for the correct command line.> Can I instansitate more functional unit> to support it?Sure, the same way you can add more functional units to O3CPU.
