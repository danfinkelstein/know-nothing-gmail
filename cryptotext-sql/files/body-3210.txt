Hello,
    I get the following error 
running equake:
 
equake:  too many subdomains(0), rerun slice 
using -s1
 
Has anyone seen this before?
 
Secondly, in our local cpu2000 repository, the 
benchmarks/cpu2000/data/equake/lgred/input contains the mcf.in... This seems to 
be wrong. Has anyone got the right file?
 
- Sujay
