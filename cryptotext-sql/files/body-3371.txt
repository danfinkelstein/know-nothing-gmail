Native execution isn't supported on any of our architectures including Alpha. I would imagine x86 will be the first architecture to get native execution support.

I know the M5 developer community is working on full-system simulation for MIPS and ARM (and even X86 down the road.)  Does it seem like anyone is working on "native execution" for any CPU model besides the Alpha?
Thanks again,

You can do single processor full-system simulation on SPARC and boot Solaris.  In theory multi-processors should work -- the code is written -- but it hasn't been tested/debugged. If you're interested in doing it we have some infrastructure to do cycle checking Legion (Sun's functional simulator) that we can share. There is currently no support for native execution on SPARCs.
(2) Simulation speed.  I need a sense of both the software and hardware performance in instructions/second.  This is a critical piece of information and I have not found it anywhere in the docs or tutorial.  I would even accept anecdotal information about M5 speed.
We get about 2M IPS on a simple CPU model. Full-system isn't supported on our out-of-order model, but it would be a good bit slower.
