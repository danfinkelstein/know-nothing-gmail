This is the 4th time you've asked your question on the list. Nate gave
you a perfectly reasonable answer to the first time:
Read the following document: http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Reporting_Problems
In it you'll find links to the documentation and FAQ, which if you
read you would realize the error you're getting is because you haven't
installed the full system kernels and disk images or haven't modified
the SysPaths.py script appropriately.
