Hi All,     I am new to this simulator. I am trying to install m5 2.0. I have already installed Python, Scons, Swig and zlib.      When I compiled m5 using scons, I used the command -      > scons build/ALPHA_FS/m5.debugand got one error - "cannot execute -python ... compilation terminated because of 1 error"Can anyone help me find the reason ? Thanks in advance. Regards-Chaitali    __________________________________________________Do You Yahoo!?Tired of spam?  Yahoo!
