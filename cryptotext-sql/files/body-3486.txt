I just wrote a few notes of things I'm looking for or will ask about, in case they're not covered:
Create a basic test.py and run the workload
Import the cpu2000.py into a test.py & run
Modify a processor configuration for a simple test.py
Use m5.prof and figure out the gmon.out -> program
Use m5.debug to debug a test.py run
Fast forwarding
Also, can I get the Alpha OSF1/tru64 binaries of SPEC CPU 2000 from you? :)
Danke,
Dan
