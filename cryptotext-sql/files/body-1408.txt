Further to my earlier email, things seems fine to me in the last few events before assertion failure:
59572419000: system.cpu15.tol2bus: recvTiming: src 1 dst 2 ReadRespWithInvalidate 0x8218c0
59572419000: system.cpu15.dcache: Handling response to 8218c0
59572419000: system.cpu15.dcache: Block for addr 8218c0 being updated in Cache
59572419000: system.cpu15.dcache: Block addr 8218c0 moving from state 0 to 5
