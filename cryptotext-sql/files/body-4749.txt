Hi,
while reading the new source code for m5 2.0b2 I've found a possible
problem. At least I think I did.
in src/cpu/simple/timing.cc:
function TransactCPU::write(T data, Addr addr, unsigned flags, uint64_t
*res)
if     Fault fault = thread->translateDataWriteReq(req) returns a
fault then an else section is
executed
inside which is "delete req"
 after which (outside of _if_else_) is called req->something
(please take a look at the source) which could return access violation
or something similar.
So, you need:
delete req;
return fault;
I've seen the same function calling pattern in a lot of files.
