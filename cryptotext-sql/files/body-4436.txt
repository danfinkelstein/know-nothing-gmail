Hello all,
      I am running the splash2 benchmarks. I want to get a trace of dram bank access patterns. How do I do this? The memory used is declared in the line:
physmem = PhysicalMemory(range=AddrRange("512MB")
When I look in the PhysicalMemory.py file, it has 2 class declarations. viz: PhysicalMemory and DRAMMemory. Why do we have both these objects? Do I need to declare the memory object as a DRAMobject and modify the associated .cc file?
