  
Hi,
You could use McPAT for this and use the M5 statistics as input.
The catch is that you'll have to write a parser to parse the m5
statistics and configuration file.
The parser should then write the input for mcpat in the proper XML
format.
Good luck!

PS: I wrote such a parser, tailored for a simple in order core. It's
not general at all, but it could inspire you a bit.- Show quoted text -

I was wondering if it was possible to do any power estimation in M5.
Something similar to the way it is done in simplescalar?
  
Best,
