You should be able to create another PhysicalMemory device and attach it to
the memory system somewhere. You can assign it an address range and for SE
mode it would probably be pretty easy to access. To access it in FS mode
you'll need to modify the kernel to make it available to a user space
application which will probably be quite time consuming.
