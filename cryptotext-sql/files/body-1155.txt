Hello,
 
I was trying to run m5_2.0beta5 version of M5, (Because I found
a patch which can be applied to this version). But while building itself I am
getting the following error. I do not understand what compiler options I have
to provide. In case of beta6 version, I didn’t get this error.
 
scons build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
 
scons: warning: The Options class is deprecated; use the
Variables class instead.
File "/home/shiva/Install/m5-2.0beta5/SConstruct",
line 261, in <module>
Error: Don't know what compiler options to use for your
compiler.
       Please fix SConstruct and src/SConscript and try
again.
 
Also tried this :
scons CC=gcc build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
 
scons: warning: The Options class is deprecated; use the
Variables class instead.
File "/home/shiva/Install/m5-2.0beta5/SConstruct",
line 261, in <module>
Error: Don't know what compiler options to use for your
compiler.
       Please fix SConstruct and src/SConscript and try
again.
 
The gcc version installed is gcc version 4.3.2 (Debian
4.3.2-1.1)
 
 
Thanks in advance,
-Shiva
