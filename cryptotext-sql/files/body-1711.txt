Look near the bottom of the M5-download page under "Really Old Version"
and you will find a  slightly modified linux 2.6.8.1 source tree. You
can cross-compile that. In general, I think all you really need is any
2.6+ kernel and a M5 diff that contains support for special M5
instructions (like checkpoint, dumpstats ... etc). After that, use the
alpha cross compiler also found on the download page and you are ready
to go. If that version of the kernel does not work and there are no
objections, I can provide a 2.6.18 kernel for you. I have problems with
the alpha cross compiler on my AMD machine (although I have stirred
fervor that AMD is not the cause) from a kernel panic, but no problems
on an Intel machine. Anyways, might as well try it out.

This was answered by Nate.

You are going to want to appl  the diffs that are present on the M5
download page. Also, make sure you are building with the right cross
compiler command for the linux kernel. Set your environment variable
CROSS_COMPILE,  and do 'make O="<path to your build directory>"
ARCH=alpha' and you should get a kernel. If you are getting gcc errors
related to a lack of ev6 support, make sure you are using the most
update gcc cross compiler.
