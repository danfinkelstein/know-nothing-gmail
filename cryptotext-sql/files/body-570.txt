If you want to do something at a specific point in the app (as opposed
to on every function call), and you have source code, your best bet is
to use a special 'm5' instruction to signal to the simulator that
you've hit that point.
I guess the overall message is that we need more details on what
you're trying to do if you want specific suggestions on how best to do
it.
