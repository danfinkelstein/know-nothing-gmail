By my understanding, the disk image for full system simulation is
read-only by default. So any data written onto it will be lost after
simulation (I am new here. Please correct if I am wrong. ) Is there
any way that I can change this configuration and keep the changes on
the disk image?
This is meaningful if a benchmark writes some intermediate results on
to disk, and I care only the computation after it generating these
results. So I can make a checkpoint of whole system including the disk
image, and simulate from the checkpoint. The other case is that, if a
benchmark comes in a installation package, I'd like to run the
installation in the simulated system and leave the installed benchmark
on the disk image.
Thanks!
