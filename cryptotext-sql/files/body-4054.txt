Hi,
I started playing around with alpha_se checkpoints on the new release. If I checkpoint at 100,000 instructions on applu for alpha_se with atomicsimplecpu, I am able to resume execution in AtomicSimpleCPU and SimpleTimingCPU, but as soon as standard_switch reaches DerivO3CPU, I get:
Assertion failed: (curTick <= mainEventQueue.nextTick() && "event scheduled in the past"), function simulate, file build/ALPHA_SE/sim/simulate.cc, line 67
If I try to just use the the detailed model out of the box, I get:
Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
Reason: KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE at address: 0x00000094
0x000bd2d1 in O3ThreadState<AlphaSimpleImpl>::getTC (this=0x0) at thread_state.hh:108
108        TheISA::Kernel::Statistics *getKernelStats() { return kernelStats; }
Any ideas?
Thanks,
-Rick
