hi,          I am running SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks on M5-2.0b6, it
was worked fine. Recently, i updated all the updates on my m5 from m5
repository. Now, when i am running simulation on M5, it is showing segmentation fault for all the benchmarks.          I am using your Mybench.py and cmp.py files from this website (http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/SPEC2006_benchmarks). it worked fine before, after updating it is giving the above error.
