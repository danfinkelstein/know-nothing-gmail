That warning just means that your stack was automatically extended
when you exceeded the allocated space. It's generally harmless (unless
it's happening very frequently) so that's probably not part of the
problem. If it's exiting extremely quickly, I'd suggest turning on
some trace flags to see if it's executing any instructions, and if so
what it's doing that makes it exit so soon. You also might have
misconfigured something and the benchmark is complaining and exiting
unexpectedly but correctly. Did you look at its console output?
