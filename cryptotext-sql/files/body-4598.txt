Hi,
 
I’m using M5_1.1. I wonder how to get information from
the m5prof.* files using the profile python script. I ran the /util/profile-top
file with the m5prof.* filename as the argument, such like:
%: profile-top m5prof.client.full0
 
However, I got ‘syntax error’ when the first line of
the m5prof file is read. The python version is 2.4. I would like to know how
can I figure this out.
 
Thanks,
Yu
