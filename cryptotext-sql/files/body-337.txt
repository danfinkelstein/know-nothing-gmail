Hi, The functions defined in util/m5(quiesce, arm etc) also seem to be defined in pseudo_inst.cc files in the /src/sim folder. Do the new instructions have to be defined in both the places? Also if we define these instructions, we need to get our benchmark compiled for an assembly code which will include these new instructions. 
Soumyaroop has suggested that we need to change the binutils folder in the crosscompiler, but we havent been able to find the specific alpha patches in any of the versions of binutils. Which version contains the alpha match that needs to be modified? 
What do you mean by "specific alpha patches" and "alpha match"? Do you mean "GNU assembler code specific to Alpha"? If I recall correctly, there should be tc-alpha.h and tc-alpha.c files in the gas/config directory in the binutils package. They have Alpha specific assembly and disassembly code. 
To be able to emulate the functionality of a new instruction in M5, you have to modify the ISA description file(s) in M5 by specifying its decode rules and its semantics.But if this is about M5 specific specialized instructions (e.g. for checkpointing or resetting stats, etc.), probably Steve, Nate or Gabe will be able to answer this better.

If the instructions aren't absolutely performance critical, it's
easier to put them in a separate .s file in functions and just call
the functions.  See how the m5-specific instructions are done in
util/m5.
