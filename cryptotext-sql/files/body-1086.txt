Hello,
  I am trying to collect memory traces running 
specweb in FS mode. However, if I use the traceflags to collect traces (say 
MemoryAccess), it starts collecting all memory requests, including the OS 
booting up. I want to collect only when the benchmark start running. How do I do 
this.?
 
Thanks,
Sujay
