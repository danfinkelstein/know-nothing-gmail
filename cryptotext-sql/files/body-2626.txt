Hi,
If an m5 simulation terminates due to a simulation limit being reached,
is it then possible that buffered I/O will not be sent out to the
terminal? I noticed that output appears to buffered for quite a while
until I see it hit the output terminal. Is there a simple way to flush
the output to terminal more often or at least before teh simulation
terminates.
The root of this question is that I am trying to add the ex_tpcb
database benchmark and in some cases I don't even see the unconditional
printf at the beginning of main(), while at other times the entire
benchmark works and I see all the printfs output to the terminal.
