This file is automatically generated from src/cpu/o3/O3CPU.py.
Basically, any parameters that you want to add, should be added in
that python file.  The build system generates a whole bunch of glue
code along with that structure as well (which you will find in the
build directory).
The most recent tutorial has stuff on adding parameters and there's
been emails about it.
