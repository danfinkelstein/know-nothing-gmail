If anyone is interested in adding support for TLS toolchains I imagine that it's as simple as loading the .tdata and .tbss sections in the same manner as we currently load the .data and .bss sections respectively. Obviously, it gets much more complicated if you have a multi-threaded program, but since we don't support pthreads in syscall emulation it's probably isn't needed. If anyone wants some more information: http://people.redhat.com/drepper/tls.pdfAli - Show quoted text -On Sep 10, 2007, at 7:54 PM, Steve Reinhardt wrote:- Show quoted text -Excellent!  Glad you got it to work.  Did you have to do anything to get it to run?  If so, please share it so that others can benefit.  (Feel free to register on the wiki and create a page there if you want.)Let us know if you run into anything else.
