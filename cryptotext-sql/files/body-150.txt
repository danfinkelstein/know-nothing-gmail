you're going to need to run the development tree.
You'll also need additional patches.  You can see here:
   http://www.csl.cornell.edu/~vince/projects/m5/m5_x86_64_se_status.html
for the status of m5 for x86_64, at least with the SPEC2000 benchmarks.
There's at least 8 patches or so there that would need to be applied
before SPEC2000 ran, I've been meaning to clean them up and submit them at
some point, but graduating/getting a new job has sucked up all my time.
In general, none of the x87 floating point support will work.  You'll need
to compile your binaries using SSE only.
I also am not sure what the status of multi-threaded programs is in X86_SE
mode, I imagine it will take a bit of work to get stock compiled PARSEC
running.
