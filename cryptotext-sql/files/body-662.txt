I have a vague recollection about this error.  I just looked into it and it came from a commit that cleaned up some stuff regarding full-system.  I was deep in the throes of thesis finishing and did a really stopgap fix - I reinserted the #if FULL_SYSTEM around that assert that had been removed in that commit.
This is really not a true solution but it might get you by.  Nate, this comes from your changeset 5803 on Jan. 19, 2009, subject thread_context.  Clues for a fix/solution?

I'm not a fast-forwarding wiz myself (Lisa?), but it loooks like if things arent working you are getting to have to get your hands dirty in the code and figure the internals of how fast forwarding is supposed to work, so you can get fix the problem.
Once you start looking at code and debugging, it might be a good idea to send emails to m5-dev, so that once you detect the problem, a patch can be generated and the repo can be updated.Alternatively, check the mailing list archives as I'm sure there have been people asking about fast forwarding in the past...

I get the same error. I also tried giving the "-s" for standard switch
and changing the value of FF. Any idea why this is happening?
Thanks,
