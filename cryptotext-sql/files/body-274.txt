I converted a CUDA application to a normal C program which has a lot of 
sqrtf and cosf calls. Another related query is, what happens if an instruction is unimplemented?-

I think that's right. Also, the panic is basically a segfault for the
simulated program. It's complaining you tried to read from address 0x2
which doesn't correspond to anything in the process's address space. If
you do find a specific bug (or implement a GPU!) please let us know.
There's more information on debugging at
