Dear m5-users,
I am trying to get the SPEC2000 eio traces to run on M5 with
InOrderCPU in SE mode. I built m5 with "EXTRAS" support using this
command:
scons EXTRAS=/path/to/m5_2.0_encumbered build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug
To run the eio traces, I modified the "se.py" script following
Michael's direction
(http://osdir.com/ml/emulators.m5.users/2006-10/msg00013.html). Then I
use the following command:
./build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug ./configs/example/se.py --inorder --caches
--l2cache --eio=/path/to/EIO_traces
But I got core dump and the error message as following:
**** REAL SIMULATION ****
For more information see: http://www.m5sim.org/warn/7f11c91a
info: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...
panic: Tried to execute unmapped address 0.
 @ cycle 58000
[invoke:build/ALPHA_SE/arch/alpha/faults.cc, line 186]

Program aborted at cycle 58000
gzip: Abort (core dumped)

==================================================
I installed several versions of M5 (with support for InOrderCPU model)
from the repository and got the same error message. I printed some
traces, it seems that there is bug in "Fetch-Seq-Unit" which assigns
dynamic instruction to PC 0x000000 (From trace: "58000:
system.cpu.Fetch-Seq-Unit: [tid:0]: Assigning [sn:3] to PC 0x000000,
NPC 0x000004, NNPC 0x000008"). I looked into the source code of
"cpu/inorder/first_stage.cc" and related files but still cannot figure
out the problem.
I wonder if someone met the same problem before (at least I haven't
found solution from the list archive) and how to make it work
correctly. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
Best,
Jing
