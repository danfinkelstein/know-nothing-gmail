If you're in full system mode, I'm pretty sure that this is currently
not possible.  It's not impossible though.  There are likely to be
some issues with translation step, and you need to keep track of which
process you're in, so that your breakpoints and such only get set on
the process you're debugging.  You should just try it and start
hacking on the remote debugger stuff.  There's a trace flag that you
can turn on to try to dump some information about what's going on.  If
you do get this working, please consider contributing the fixes.
