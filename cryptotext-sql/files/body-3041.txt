I'm not sure exactly what you're asking about.  At a high level, I think the names are pretty descriptive.  If you want to know exactly what any of the flags does, the best approach is just to look at how it's used in the code.  (For finding where it's used, i'm partial to cscope--there's a script in util to build a cscope index of the m5 code--but grep is OK too.)
If you've looked through the code and still have specific questions, feel free to post them here.  You're far more likely to get a useful answer (and far more likely to really understand how things work) if you ask specific questions after you've tried to figure things out on your own.

The following type is defined in the class Event.My question is what is the meaning of the member variable?    enum Flags {            None = 0x0,            Squashed = 0x1,            Scheduled = 0x2,
            AutoDelete = 0x4,            AutoSerialize = 0x8,            IsExitEvent = 0x10        }; What's more, there are many more of these type. Where can i find the meaning of their member?
Thank you very much!
