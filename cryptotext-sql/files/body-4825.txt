Hello,
I am just doing my first steps with m5 2.0b1p1, so I have a few questions:
1) Is it possible to configure a unified L1 cache? If so, how is it done?
2) The simulator aborts when I configure the l1dc to be 1-way associative:
command line: ./build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug ./configs/jonas/se1.py -c tests/test-progs/hello/bin/alpha/linux/hello -t
warn: Entering event queue @ 0. Â Starting simulation...
warn: Increasing stack 0x11ff92000:0x11ff9b000 to 0x11ff90000:0x11ff9b000 because of access to 0x11ff91ff0
m5.debug: build/ALPHA_SE/mem/request.hh:229: int Request::getThreadNum(): Assertion `validCpuAndThreadNums' failed.
Program aborted at cycle 3916
Aborted
Is this a known issue?
Regards,
Jonas
