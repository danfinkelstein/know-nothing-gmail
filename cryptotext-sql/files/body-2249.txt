Hi all,
I have mesh + directory coherence (based on Jiayuan's patches) running
the beginning of a script  in full system and see output coming from the
terminal. However, I am getting an assertion in the ide_disk.cc a little
later:
Assertion failed: (cmdBytesLeft == 0), function dmaWriteDone, file
/Users/rickstrong/build/m5powerfs/build/ALPHA_FS/dev/ide_disk.cc, line 497.
As I am running for a deadline, I don't really care about the accuracy
of the disk model. Is there a simpler disk that I could use that might
get me around the complexity of figuring how dma is interacting with the
disk?
Best,
-Rick
