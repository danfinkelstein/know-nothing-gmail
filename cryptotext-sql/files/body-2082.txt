Sorry for the slow response, like Steve mentioned I have been working
on a final draft for a paper.
Looking at the code I'm fairly certain you're correct, BTB's update()
should be called in that same update() function.  The BTB functions
within the bpred_unit.hh (BTBValid, BTBLookup, BTBUpdate) are
unfortunately deprecated at this point -- they aren't called anywhere
and don't include a thread id.  I'll look into updating this code, but
if you want to make local changes in the meantime, I would suggest
using a call to BTB.update() like the one seen in
BPredUnit<Impl>::squash().

  Good question.  It looks to me like BTBUpdate should be called from
BPredUnit<Impl>::update() like BPUpdate is.  I know Kevin's in the
middle of getting a final version of a paper ready, but perhaps when
he's done he'll have time to take a look and see if we're both missing
something.

    I have noticed that BTBUpdate in bpred_unit.hh never gets called. Is this supposed to be such or is it that it depends upon certain parameters/type of predictor etc.
