our code base right now that does that, though it should not be hard to do.Lisa

How do you commuincate between these multiple interconnected systems.
What function do you use and how are they connected if not over an ethernet bus
system.
Also I noticed in FS.py the --dual systems comment says it connects the two
systems via an ethernet link.
This is the opposite of what you say below isn't it?
