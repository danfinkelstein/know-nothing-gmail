When using four stock O3CPUs, I hit the following assertion after
running a long time:
m5.fs.opt: build/ALPHA_FS/cpu/base_dyn_inst_impl.hh:178: void
BaseDynInst<Impl>::initVars() [with Impl = O3CPUImpl]: Assertion
`instcount <= 1500' failed.
Given that instcount is a static shared by all processors, and the
1500 is not scaled to account for the number of processors, is it
possible the value is just too low? I have attempted to tally up how
many instructions could microarchitecturally been in flight, but I am
not familiar enough with the precise organization of the O3CPU to say
for sure whether or not four cores would clear this limit, though it
appears that eight or more cores would easily hit this limit.
Is there an issue in the O3 CPU that I am possibly running into, or
can I safely disable it?
Thanks,
