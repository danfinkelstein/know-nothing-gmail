Yes now it is working if I do not use DRAMsim, when I use DRAMsim it does not work. I think this is related with what Nate say that it is not common to checkpoint time related things.The reason to use fastforwarding is to speed up the simulation. Do you have a copy and paste example of fastforwarding in FS that I can take as an example?. I want to fastfoward for exmple 200e6 instructions switch to detailed do my stuff for 100e6 and after fastfoward again until the end of the simulation.Also I saw in a post that Nate said that it is possible to take stats when the simulation reach a certain cycle number, I could not find any documentation to do this, can anyone post an explanation of how this can be done?.Thanks a lot in advance.> From: saidi@umich.edu> To: m5-users@m5sim.org> Date: Thu, 19 Feb 2009 13:45:35 -0500- Show quoted text -> Subject: Re: [m5-users] [PATCH] Beta patch for M5 2.0 DRAMsim implemention> > > On Feb 19, 2009, at 1:15 PM, Angela Carlsson wrote:> > > Hello Ali thanks for the answer, you were right was an M5 bug, I was  > > using a little bit old version of M5 I updated and the error was  > > gone.
