Hello,
   I want to run CPU2000 benchmarks on m5_2.0b3. How could I generate
*.rcS files by the CPU2000 input sets and binaries.
   In FAQ it shows cpu2000.py can be used to create an m5 workload
parameter based on benchmark name, isa, operating system, and input
set. To make cpu2000.py work for me, I only have to change spec_dist to
point to wherever I keep my cpu2000 binaries/input sets.
   Does that mean I should change spec_dist to my appointed directory and
put my input sets to
      spec_dist/data/BENCHMARK/INPUTSET/FILES
  and binaries to
      spec_dist/binaries/ARCH/OPSYS/BENCHMARK
Thanks,
Rongrong
