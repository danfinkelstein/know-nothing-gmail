I’m experimenting with moving the interrupt controller
(cchip) up the memory hierarchy to be much closer to the CPUs for faster
access.  But when I assign the cchip to be connected to the l2bus, m5
panics immediately with this error:
 
command line: ../../build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt fs1.py -b
thread_scaletest32 -k vmlinux.expbackoff -t -n 4 --caches --l2cache -m

Looking in config.ini, the cchip is connected twice, once to
the l2bus *and* to the iobus, which is causing the panic and before hand
the warning.  I can’t find where the cchip is being always assigned
to the iobus, especially after I override it by connecting it to the l2bus in
fs.py.  Any ideas?
 
Thanks,
Geoff
