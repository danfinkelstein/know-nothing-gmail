Hi all,I have a question with my running result of facesim and streamcluster 
application of PARSEC. I tested them on different cache configuration 
with the same 8-core CPU config. 
my cache configuration is:same on L1 cache: 2-way, 64 bytes block 
size, 64kb IL1 cache and 64kb DL1 cachedifferent on L2 cache and
 L2 cache is the last level cache. a). 4-way, 8M size of L2 cache  b).
 8-way, 8M size of L2 cache
c). 16-way, 8M size of L2 cacheNormally, the higher way 
set-associative L2 cache config will have less misses, but my experiment
 results show the 4-way cache has fewest misses, 8-way second, and 
16-way has the biggest misses. However these only happen to facesim and 
streamcluster, other applications are reasonable. 
So i want to know whether any one come across with the same problem or something wrong?  Thank 
you in advance.Sheng
