I've noticed that the final trace time in a normal run:
build/ALPHA_SE/m5.opt configs/example/se.py -c tests/test-progs/hello/bin/alpha/linux/hello
and a run that pipes the results to a file
build/ALPHA_SE/m5.opt configs/example/se.py -c tests/test-progs/hello/bin/alpha/linux/hello | tee hello_output
have different cycle times. In the case of an unmodified m5_b5, they are 3208500 and 2871500 respectively. Any idea what may cause this difference? (or does this not happen for you, in which case something very odd is going on on my end)
