I have built it before on Sun OS 10 using the gcc front end for sun cc
compiler GCCFSS. At least 18 months ago that worked fine. You should
run it in a debugger and see where the error is occurring in the
build, as that would help debug it. FYI, You don't need build
SPARC_(SE|FS) on a SPARC machine, it will work on x86 hardware as well.
