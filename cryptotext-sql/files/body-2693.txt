Yes, I run m5 (v1.1) regularly on a cluster managed by condor. It rather
depends on how your condor is configured and also if anything relevant
has changed in m5 v2 but I have a Python script called m5.launch running
in the vanilla universe that sets up some environment variables
(corresponding to which configuration and benchmark to run) which then
does something like:
process = subprocess.Popen(...)
process.wait()
So the condor submission file looks like this:
# Condor submission file
# Generic things
universe        = vanilla
executable      = /homes/jrs53/src/m5/m5/bin/m5.launch
#requirements   = memory >= 4000
output          = $ENV(M5_RESULTS)_condor/out.gzip_source
error           = $ENV(M5_RESULTS)_condor/err.gzip_source
log             = $ENV(M5_RESULTS)_condor/log.gzip_source
arguments       = --benchmark=gzip_source
--results=$ENV(M5_RESULTS)_gzip_source
--fast_cycles=$ENV(M5_FAST_CYCLES)
--detail_cycles=$ENV(M5_DETAIL_CYCLES) --con
fig=$ENV(M5_CONFIG) --sim=$ENV(M5_SIM)
queue           1
(may wrap)
This may be needlessly complex and was originally necessary to get
around some file permissions issues on our system. If you can log in
directly to the condor machines try running m5 from there and see what
happens.
Hope this helps,
James
