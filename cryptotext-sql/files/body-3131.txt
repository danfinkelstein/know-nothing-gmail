We don't implement the kill system call because implementing support
signal handlers would be rather difficult.  That said, it certainly
could be done if you really wanted to.  Korey's solution seems like a
reasonable one as well.  In fact, we might consider an exit on a
process sending a signal to itself, but ignore the others.
