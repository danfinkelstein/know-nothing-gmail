I'm trying to clean up my my inbox and I saw that nobody responded to
this.  Sorry if this is way to late to help, but I thought I'd
respond.
The short answer is, sure you can implement different memory models.
The longer answer is that it can potentially require significant
effort.  You'd have to write your own network model and cache model.
