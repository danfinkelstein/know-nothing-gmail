Hi,
I have tried compiling M5 through 'scons build/ALPHA_FS/m5debug' or 'python
scons.py' but I keep getting this error irrespective of the type of simulator
im building:
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
Checking for C header file fenv.h... (cached) yes
Building in /local/sharookh/m5/build/ALPHA_SE
Using saved options file /local/sharookh/m5/build/options/ALPHA_SE
Compiling in ALPHA_SE with MySQL support.
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
swig -c++ -python -modern -Iext/dnet -I/usr/include/python2.4
-Ibuild/libelf/include -I/usr/include/mysql -Ibuild/ALPHA_SE -outdir
build/ALPHA_SE/python/m5 -o build/ALPHA_SE/python/swig/cc_main_wrap.cc
build/ALPHA_SE/python/swig/cc_main.i
build/ALPHA_SE/python/swig/cc_main.i:11: Unable to find 'stdint.i'
scons: *** [build/ALPHA_SE/python/swig/cc_main_wrap.cc] Error 1
scons: building terminated because of errors.
Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong.
Thanks.
