Hi,
   I added some new files in m5/src/mem directory. In m5_2.0b1 version, I
should add these files'name in the m5/src/SConscript in order to
compile these files into m5. But this SConscript file is different from
that in m5_2.0b1 version. What should I do?
   I also added some new .py files in m5/src/python/m5/objects directory.
In m5_2.0b1 version, I should add these files'name in the __init__.py.
But in m5_2.0b3 version, there is no such file. What should I do?
Thanks,
Tracy
