Thanks Gabe and Steve for your suggestions. What I am trying to do is
integrated wattch in M5 beta 5, using Rick Strong's basic code.
It consists of a lot of counters integrated into various O3 implementation
files (*_impl.hh), mem/cache/cache_impl.hh and calling the power
calculations routines from power.c in simulate.cc He used a separate
definitions files in which he defined the constants used for simulation (say
numcpus or memory size), since his code did not have any hooks to get the
information from python.
for example: I would need to access to various system parameters - say the
value of numcpus supplied at runtime, the value of memory size, etc. These
are specified by the user using the config script and I assume some
SimObject is created for the at runtime. Some other things like lsq_size are
defined in O3CPU.py and I would need to access it.
Currently the values are obtained by using a #include<> (in each of those
files above) to include the file which has these parameters defined. So
everytime we change a simulation parameter, this file has to be edited
manually.
So what would be the best way of going about this?
Secondly, is this the best way of integrating wattch into M5? (modifying all
the files I mentioned above). Or can you suggest a more cleaner approach
that would work for all CPU models.
Thanks,
Sujay
