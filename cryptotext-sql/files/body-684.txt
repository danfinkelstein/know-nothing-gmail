My problem was that I had not exactly followed the instructions on http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Compiling_a_Linux_Kernel. Just run them again           one by one and hopefully you'll get the .config.m5 file.

Hello Amir,
 
I am also not able to find .config.m5 file.  
“cp: cannot stat `.config.m5': No such file or directory”
 
How did you resolve this?
 
Thanks

So, I figured it out. I was
doing something wrong. :) so now i have the kernel compiled. How to do I update
the kernel in the  disk image that I downloaded form m5's website to the
version i just compiled? The tutorial does not say anything about it.
Thanks

Hi,
I am trying to upgrade my kernel from 2.6.13 to 2.6.27 based on the
instructions found at http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Compiling_a_Linux_Kernel
One of the steps is :
cp .config.m5 .config
I can not find .config.m5 or .config files in the checked out directory. 
I created my own .config file by running "make menuconfig" but
couldn't figure out how to get .config.m5 . Am I missing something? Is there a
better way to do this? 
I was wondering why the disk image on the website does not come with the latest
version of kernel supported by m5? That could save a lot of time.
Thanks.
Amir
