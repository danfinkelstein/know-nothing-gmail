Hi,
I'm working with the InOrderCPU on ALPHA_SE.
I'm running one core, with one thread, split level 1 caches and physical memory.
The stats-file gives me a lot of statistics, but nothing about the physical memory. Some statistics are derivable form the cache's statistics, but not all.
Since I want to use McPAT to get a power estimate I'm more precisely interested in the following two parameters:
-Number of memory reads
-Number of memory writes
Is there somebody who already needed those statistics and came to a solution?
It would save me a lot of work :-).
The number of memory reads will probably equal to the number of [data cache ReadReq_misses] plus [instruction cache ReadReq_misses].
The number of memory writes will be more difficult to calculate: it equals [number of evicted cache lines that were written] plus [number of data cache WriteReq_misses].
So basically what I need is "the number of evicted cache lines that were written".
Regards,
Max
