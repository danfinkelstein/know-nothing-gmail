This is Alpha O3 and timing, no idea what instruction is causing the error, since it is four hours into the simulation and nothing except the fatal error message is printed out. All of the configurations have the same number of cpus (16) with the same configuration for the private L1 and L2 caches, though the rest of the memory system is varied. All use the same disk image, and the simulation is running full-system (though boot is performed in atomic mode).Given that it occurs after four hours of simulation, it would take days to even produce execution traces of that point in the code, so that is an intractable solution. Is there a way of getting a more informative error message at the point of the error?	- Clint- Show quoted text -On Apr 1, 2009, at 3:13 PM, Korey Sewell wrote:You would need to know what type of CPU model (assuming O3), what ISA, and what instruction is causing that problem.You could probably look in the ISA description format (i.e. arch/alpha/mem.isa) or the generated code (i.e. build/ALPHA_SE/arch/alpha/o3_cpu_exec.cc) to figure out what code is being generated for that instruction. Without knowing what "other" configurations work and what "other" ones don't work it's hard to analyze the problem.On a first-cut guess, I'm assuming that you are executing a privileged (misc.) instruction in O3 mode which doesn't support the split level access.  What I would do is compare your broken simulation execution trace with that of the AtomicSimpleCPU's execution trace. Wherever the instructions differ, is probably where your problem is.

Other workloads on the same configuration finish correctly, and the same workload on other configurations finishes fine. From my reading of the code, the error should only occur if an instruction object was corrupted, since otherwise they would always be correctly built for the specific ISA, yes?         Does anyone have any other ideas for how to determine the error?         - Clint Smullen _______________________________________________ m5-users mailing list m5-users@m5sim.org http://m5sim.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/m5-users -- ----------Korey L SewellGraduate Student - PhD CandidateComputer Science & EngineeringUniversity of Michigan _______________________________________________m5-users mailing listm5-users@m5sim.orghttp://m5sim.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/m5-users_______________________________________________
