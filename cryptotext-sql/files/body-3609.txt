You would have a special command (via an ASI or IPR) that is flushes a particular line if the asid matches and you could call it N times.

Often there are two types of special IPRs or memory regions (or ASIs
in SPARC land): one that says "flush the cache line (if any) that
matches this address" and another that says "flush the contents of the
cache line at this physical index into the cache array".  So a generic
cache flush would be a loop over the N lines in the cache using the
second type of access, while if you're manually trying to keep a
particular location coherent you might use the first type of access.
But how would you flush just the lines for a particular address space?
I'm guessing that no machines do that today, but I can imagine
machines of the future not having full coherence across the entire
chip, and wanting to do some sort of coarse software based coherence
for process migration.  I could imagine a "flush cache line X if it
matches asn Y" instruction.
