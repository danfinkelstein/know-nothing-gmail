In
FAQ of m5 wiki site, it says:Â  "In SE mode, simply create a system with
multiple CPUs and assign a different workload object to each CPU's
workload parameter. If you're using the O3 model, you can also assign a
vector of workload objects to one CPU, in which case the CPU will run
all of the workloads concurrently in SMT mode"
Is there any sample script of how to assign a workload object to
different CPUs, thanks? Right now, I am trying to run different mibench
benchmarks on a multicore system. 
Thanks
