Hi,
        Referring to beta 4 
release notes:
 
1.  Is the use of TLBs in SE mode by default, 
or do we need to explicitly enable it?
 
2. Since python is used to create the structs 
automatically, how many files do we need to modify to add, say, one extra 
parameter.
   for eg: in dram.cc, if I want to have 
a new parameter, do I still need to declare it in the relevant sections in all 
of the:
 
dram.cc
dram.hh
PhysicalMemory.hh
 
files, or is there a simper way to do 
it?
 
Thanks,
Sujay
