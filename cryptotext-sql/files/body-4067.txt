If you're using the released version, the answer is unfortunately yes, for
now.
Nate has streamlined this code considerably in our internal tree, but that's
still held up for distribution for the moment...

I want to add some parameters to the DRAM object. Example, if I want to
add a 'energy' parameter (float) as an input to the DRAM, can I do the
following:
Add lines:
EnergyLP1 = Param.Float(1E-6,"Energy in Low Power State 1")
to the "DRAMMemory.py" and "PhysicalMemory.py" files
and
EnergyLP1(p->EnergyLP1)
to the
DRAMMemory::DRAMMemory(Params *p)
BEGIN_DECLARE_SIM_OBJECT_PARAMS(DRAMMemory)
BEGIN_INIT_SIM_OBJECT_PARAMS(DRAMMemory)
CREATE_SIM_OBJECT(DRAMMemory)
sections of the dram.cc file
Do I have to specify it in all these sections?
Thanks,
Sujay
