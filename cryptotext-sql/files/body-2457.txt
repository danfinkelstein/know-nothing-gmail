Hi Nate thanks for your answer, what do you mean with very limited, for example I got a program with 8 threads and I want two threads per core, is it possible do that?. And if does can you post some sample code about managing threads in the simulator, or where I can find that info, thank you so much again.

Yes, this is true.  Just so you know though, currently we only support
a very limited form of threading in SE mode right now to support
splash.  I have lofty goals of getting pthreads working, but it will
be a few months.  If you want to help, let me know.  There is an
existing user level pthreads implementation that we can leverage to
make it work.
