Hi,I'm a new M5 user. I've read that some people have been working on the integration of M5 and McPAT.The README file of McPAT says that Richard Strong is working on a parser for M5, and that its latest version is available on the repository, but I couldn't find it.
I'd like to know more about it. Where can I find more info?Thanks in advance.-- Gustavo Henrique NiheiLAPS - Laboratório de Automação do Projeto de Sistemas
