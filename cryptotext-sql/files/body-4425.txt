Sometimes a request is not generated from a CPU, but from a writeback from a cache for example or a I/O device.  This means that the CPU ID is not set.  You will either need to determine the way in which you want to charge any requests not generated by a CPU and implement that when the request is created, or check to make sure the cpuID is valid before using it.  If it isn't valid you will need to determine what you wish to do.  If you are trying to keep stats on the CPU ID in the memory system you could just keep a seperate stat for requests not generated by a CPU.
