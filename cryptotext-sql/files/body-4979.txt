I would have posted my Benchmarks.py file on the wiki but I'm not 100%
sure it'll work with m5 v2 without changes. As far as I'm concerned it
can be used however anyone sees fit. It could do with more (some) error
checking and maybe a little more configurability. Unfortunately I have a
looming thesis deadline and it works well enough for my purposes so I'm
not really able to spend much time tinkering.
