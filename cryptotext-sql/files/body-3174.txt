Thanks Steve. What about --fast-forward. How does that impact the MP workload. Is there a way to set a simpoint for each cpu?
Also, sometimes I want to terminate the simulation because it takes forever to finish and send SIGINTP (signal 2) to m5. Sometimes it prints the statistics while sometimes it exits without printing any statistics. Any idea?
