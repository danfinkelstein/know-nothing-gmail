Hello there,
The performance of M5 in simulating an inorder-timing CPU seems to be
significantly lower than that in simulating an o3-timing CPU (0.33X for
gzip for 10 M instructions) in their default configurations. Does that
sound correct? I would expect it to be the other way around unless, of
course, there are differences in their implementations which affects
the performance. I am using the Alpha ISA in SE mode.
