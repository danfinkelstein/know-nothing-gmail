I see that there are some stubs in the code for other hardware
prefetchers other than the sequentialtagged ones. Is it possible
to download them from somewhere? Even if they are not complete or
even tested yet?
Also is there an anoymous CVS/SVN repository somewhere? I looked at
the m5sim.org page and the sourceforge one, and I couldn't find anything
there.
