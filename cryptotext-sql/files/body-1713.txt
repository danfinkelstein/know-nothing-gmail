Hi, all, has anybody sucessully using a Gentoo stage3 as an image to boot M5? I have tried many times, Every time I use it, the following error comes up:  * Your kernel is too old to work with this version of udev.
 * Current udev only supports Linux kernel 2.6.15 and newer.
 * Mounting devpts at /dev/pts ...                                        [
ok ]
 * Checking root filesystem ...ext2fs_check_if_mount: No such file or
directory while determining whether /dev/hda1 is mounted.
fsck.ext3: No such file or directory while trying to open /dev/hda1
/dev/hda1:
The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2
filesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2
filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock
is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:
    e2fsck -b 8193 <device>
 * Filesystem couldn't be fixed :(
                                                                          [

Give root password for maintenance
(or type Control-D to continue):
I have modified the /etc/fstab, and set the following line:    /dev/hda1  /  ext3  noatime  0 1
from the initial process of M5term, I can judge that the hard disk m5 simulates is IDE disk, that is hda and hdb, and thepartition table of hdb is unrecognized, so only hda1 works. The Gentoo website suggest using /dev/sda3, but it certainly 
doesn't work in M5, because I have tried both sda1 and sda3 as root.  The boot option of Linux is also root=/dev/hda1,  so what may be the reason causing this ? Thanks !  Further, could somebody give an example of replacing gentoo's default initial script. The /etc/inittab seems not allowed
to replace, and the /etc/runlevel/boot or /etc/runlevel/default which is designated in inittab take too long to boot. Where should I place mine ?  Thanks!
