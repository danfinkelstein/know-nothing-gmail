I know of two people (myself included) who frequently compile on OS X 10.4. We both use gettext from DarwinPorts (MacPorts) without problem. So I don't know why you're having an issue, but if you could try passing -L/opt/local/lib to the compiler or setting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (as oppopsed to LD_LIBRARY_PATH).

Thanks for the suggestion, you were right, adding it to my include path let the file be found. Although it appears the library itself isn't being found now, since it complains about unresolved externals (textdomain, bindtextdomain, gettext). Grepping my libintl.a shows these guys, so I'm guessing they're there, but the linker is having trouble finding them. Unfortunately, I tried exporting LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib, but no such luck.  Do you know of any other options for telling it where a library is?

   I'm not sure what's causing your problem, but one thing I notice is that it's not scons that's having an error, it's make running in the libelf directory. We have a private copy of libelf just for m5's purposes, but it was developed seperately and has it's own build system. The real question is why make isn't finding the header files. That might be because they aren't in the compiler's include search paths, which you might be able to correct by setting the C_INCLUDE_PATH environment variable as explained here:

Now I know I have libintl.h on my system (its in the gettext's  macports directory at /opt/local/include). Is there any way to find  out where scons is looking for the file? Has anyone else run into  this problem? For info, my python version is 2.4.3 (from macports)  and scons is 0.96.95 (compiled myself).
Thanks,
Nick
