Thanks everyone.  So you believe the crosstool will work correctly if I
just use the 2.6.12 libc header files?  Am I understanding you
correctly?
So I've found a machine with a newer version of libc and I've been able
to move ahead with the crosstool provided on the M5 download page.  I'm
curious if you have found the need to remove the "-Werror" flag from the
linux-2.6/alpha/kernel/Makefile?  I needed to in order to get through a
significant portion of the Linux cross-compile?  Otherwise I encounter
the following error.  Have you had a similar experience?

After removing the "-Werror" flag, I encounter the following error.

patch-2.6.22-rc2-git6.bz2 I may be able to resolve this error.  However,
before I do so, I just wanted to make sure that I'm on the right path.
Thanks again everyone for the quick responses!

You can change the kernel that it uses.  I actually don't normally use
the demo-alpha script.  I created my own based on it.  I'll try to
find my scripts and send them out.
