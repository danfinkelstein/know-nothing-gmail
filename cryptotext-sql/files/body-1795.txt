EISA bus registeredThe command I run is build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt -d --cache -n 4     and    m5term localhost 3456I have successfully run this before but it just happened yesterday. I don't know what I should do now, I have searched the mail list, It seems that this problem has happened before, but I am not quite clear how to fix this? Does somebody have any idea ? Thanks !
