I'm a new user running m5;
When I try to start m5 up I run into an error "access out of bounds"
and am directed to file [read:build/ALPHA_FS/dev/disk_image.cc].
Said source file exists, but is empty.  How do I go about
replacing/restoring it?
While I am at it, is where can I find the panic method, or
documentation on how it works?
Thanks,
Adam
