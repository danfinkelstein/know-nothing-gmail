Hi,
I've been experimenting with the x86 support in M5. What I would like to
do is run an i386 program (not x86_64) in syscall emulation mode. For
this project, I only want an execution trace (e.g. --trace-flags=Exec),
so there's no need for cache simulation or O3.
However I seem to be having trouble running i386 binaries. x86_64
binaries work, but i386 ones generate this error (with latest M5 and
2.0b6):
> command line: build/X86_SE/m5.opt configs/example/se.py -c ./hello
> Global frequency set at 1000000000000 ticks per second
> warn: Unknown architecture: 3
> fatal: Object file architecture does not match compiled ISA (x86).
Is this expected? I've looked at the source to see where this error
comes from and it seems that only x86_64 is supported, but this is
confusing to me, because when I see "x86", I expect x86 (i386) rather
than x86_64. Any thoughts?
Thanks in advance, and thankyou for all your excellent work on M5,
Jack
