If I had to make a wild guess, I think you may be having problems with
input or output files not being accessible, or maybe being corrupted.
I'm not sure what compiler your binaries were compiled with, or if
fortran error numbers are standardized, but error 24 is "End-of-file
during read" for DEC Fortran:
http://www.helsinki.fi/atk/unix/dec_manuals/df90au52/dfum033.htm
The rest of that error message just says that it tried to look up the
text error message for that error number but couldn't find the file
that does that.
SImilarly with lucas, if the program is calling exit() after 80K
instructions it's because something very early went wrong, like it
didn't like the command-line arguments or couldn't find an input file.
 I'm very surprised you're not getting an error message somewhere
(from the app if not from m5).
That reminds me... could the command-line arg issues we were having
with the splash scripts (where you need to manually split the command
line into args) be an issue here too?
