Hi all
I have several questions, can you give me some ideas?
1) The sampled vmlinux downloaded from m5 website is only suitable for
the case which has less than 4 cpu. Is this right?
2) If I hope the number of CPU is more than 4, I need to recompile the
linux kernel instead of the sampled vmlinux. In this case how can I do
it? Or there is such new kernel we can download from m5 website?
3) When I'm trying create a bigger image disk,I do it following the
instruction "Compiling benchmarks for the image and creating the image
with linux-dist". But I meet an error as following, how can I fix it?
