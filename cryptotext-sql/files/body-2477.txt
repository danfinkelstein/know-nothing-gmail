Hi, 
 
I have working on running some openMP
application on M5 simulator in ALPHA_FS mode. 
However, gcc 4.1.1 do not support the
openMP library.
I am wondering if there is any gcc 4.2.0 (or
newer) cross compiler or any other way to run openMP application on M5.
Thanks for your reading!
Any help would be grateful.
 
Dennis
