Hi Lisa,
      sorry for bothering 
you. I hope you could answer another question. In the surge-server.rcs, it 
mounts the fileset with the command
 
mkdir -p /z/htdocs 
mount /dev/hdb1 /z/htdocs
 
As I understand, we need a virtual device /dev/hdb1 
in the virtual system within M5. 
How do I say that /dev/hdb1 is to point to the 
surge-fileset.img? I cant see any line in FSconfig.py or Benchmarks.py which 
sets this.
 
In FSConfig.py, the makeLinuxAlphaSystem creates 
the base Tsunami system with ethernet and ide. Should there be any changes here 
to point to the fileset?
 
I can see how linux-latest.img is defined with 
Benchmarks.py in the class SysConfig:
 
return.env.get('LINUX_IMAGE', 
disk('linux-latest.img'))
 
Do i need to define something like 
this?
 
Thanks,
Sujay

  model with inorder execution core
  Either InOrder or TimingCPU.
  
  O3 stands for out-of-order, so you definitely don't want that if you want 
  an in-order core.
  
  TimingCPU is a 1CPI machine that can be attached to a timing memory 
  model.
  
  InOrder is new, and Korey can speak more to it, but I believe it is a 
  mildly pipelined in-order CPU, more realistic than TimingCPU.  However, I 
  am not positive, nor do I know if it is really production ready - Korey?
