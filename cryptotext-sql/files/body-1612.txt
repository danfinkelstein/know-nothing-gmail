That does make sense.  CowDiskImage is a copy on write disk image and
is designed to be a layer on top of another disk image.  Basically we
use it to prevent writes from changing the original disk image by
storing writes in the Cow layer, and passing reads that don't hit in
the cow layer to the layer below.  Generally people do use a
CowDiskImage, so it is fine to only hack this one.
