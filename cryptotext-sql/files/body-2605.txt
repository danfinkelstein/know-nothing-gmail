Hi,
I am trying to access the size that was set for the AlphaISA::DTB(ITB)
from an instance of DerivO3CPUParams (call it do3p for this email).
However, it would seem that do3p->dtb{itb} points to an actual
AlphaISA::DTB structure that has already been created. I am not sure
what file I need to include so the compiler will recognize
AlphaISA::DTB  so I can do something along the lines of wattch.dtb.size
= do3p->dtb->params()->size. Any help would be appreciated.
