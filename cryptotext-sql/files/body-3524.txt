But that won't create a checkpoint at 300M instructions, although using that with a modified Simulation.py could result in the checkpoint being generated.

I believe there was a thread about max instructions but that was in
reference to running simulations with multiple threads or instruction
streams.
If this is just a single-threaded simulation, I think he can just
specify "max_insts=X" on the command line to get his desired effect of
stopping at 300M instructions.

The basic clock rate is 1 ps (1 THz).  I think you really want (1
THz/1 Ghz) * 300M, which would be 3x10^11 not 3x10^17 ticks.
As an aside, if you want to fast forward 300M instructions and not
necessarily 300M cycles, it would be good to be able to specify that
directly... didn't we just have a thread on the mailing list about
that?  I don't think it's in the code right now, but did someone out
there add it?  If so, would you mind contributing the code back?

hi everybody,
  this is my first time to fast forward instructions using
AtomicSimpleCPU. I want to fast forward to 300M instructions (for gzip
graphic-ref) so I fast forward to (1Ghz * 300M= 3x10^17 ticks), its now
been simulating for 29hrs now and I decided to attach 'm5term' and it
says "113180285494000: system_remote.gdb: remote gdb attached". My
question is, is that number the tick number? If it is and assuming
constant ticks/second execution of the simulator, if I divide
(3X10^17)/1131180285494000=265. Does this mean the whole simulation will
take 265*29hrs?
this is the command that i invoked:
[me@mymachine] ./build/ALPHA_SE/m5.opt
--stats-file=statsdir/gzip_graphic_stats.txt configs/example/se.py
--cmd=/home/m5user/m5/spec2000/binaries/alpha/tru64/gzip --input=
/home/m5user/m5/spec2000/data/gzip/ref/input/input.graphic
--max_checkpoints=1 --take_checkpoints=300000000000000000,10000
--checkpoint_dir=cpt_gzip_gra
btw,
 i adjusted my clockrate in se.py to be 1Ghz.
thanks in advance,
-dean
