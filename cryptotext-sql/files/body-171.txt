Thanks for the answer.I need to log every write and read instruction when it is issued by the processor. Both write and read with address and data.In the AtomicSimpleCPU I already found where to get that information.
Could you give me a hint to do this in the O3?I'm looking into the cpu.hh, LSQ and LSQ unit, but I need to be sure.Using Sparc_SE.--Eberle A. Rambo.- Show quoted text -

As far as I know, the O3 model has only been used extensively with
Alpha, particularly in multiprocessor systems.  (Someone please speak
up if you've used it with another ISA in MP modeling.)  As a result,
O3 has only been designed to support Alpha's weak memory model.  If
whatever it does is sufficient for TSO or PSO that's purely
coincidence.  One thing that would need to be added for some stronger
models (certainly for SC) is that invalidations forwarded from the L1
dcache up to the CPU, which are currently dropped on the floor, would
need to be handled in order to invalidate speculative loads as well.
