Why is that? The ReadExRequest can be sent from the L1 to the L1-L2 bus
after a write miss. At
The mean time, this requested cache block might be shared in other L1
caches, as well as the L2. Because other L1s are snooping the bus, each
cache(L1/L2) containing a copy should send a ReadExResponse back while
invalidating its own copy theoretically, (although M5 uses the global
pointer to the packet to ensure there is only one response).
Thanks!
