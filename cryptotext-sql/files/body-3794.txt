I have a question regarding  Bus::recvTiming
 
In this function, occupyBus() calculates when the packet is received 
completely by dest_port (tickNextIdle). However, "sendTiming" is executed 
instantly afterwards without delay (both to dest_port and snoop ports). I 
understand the "adding instead of dividing" trick, but for this latency model to 
be effective, shouldn't the dest_port and snoop ports see the packet at 
tickNextIdle?  Am I missing something?
 
Thanks!
