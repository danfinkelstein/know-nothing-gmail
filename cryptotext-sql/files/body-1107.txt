Hi,I am testing simulations using SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks in newly updated M5 (using hg clone http://repo.m5sim.org/m5 newm5 ) in SE mode. I'm facing problems on running simulations as it gives 0 values on almost all parameters while running 2 core 8 threads. But i'm not getting such problems on 2 core 2 threads and 2 core 4 threads. Please have a look for: The simulation A works well but Simulation B has 0 values on stats.txt file under output folder:
Simulation A:num of cpus = 2num threads per cpu = 2system.cpu[0].workload = [Mybench.bzip2(), Mybench.libquantum()]system.cpu[1].workload = [Mybench.gobmk(), Mybench.soplex()]
Global frequency set at 1000000000000 ticks per second**** REAL SIMULATION ****info: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...Exiting @ cycle 102500 because all threads reached the max instruction count
Simulation B:num of cpus = 2num threads per cpu = 8system.cpu[0].workload = [Mybench.gromacs(), Mybench.cactusADM(), Mybench.bzip2(), Mybench.gobmk(), Mybench.leslie3d(), Mybench.hmmer(), Mybench.soplex(), Mybench.sjeng()]
system.cpu[1].workload = [Mybench.libquantum(), Mybench.milc(), Mybench.gcc(), Mybench.gcc(), Mybench.libquantum(), Mybench.milc(), Mybench.gobmk(), Mybench.sjeng()]Global frequency set at 1000000000000 ticks per second
**** REAL SIMULATION ****info: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...Exiting @ cycle 9223372036854775807 because simulate() limit reachedI have read the previous posts related to similar problems but i'm not getting much benefits. Could any one please help me just providing how can I fix this problem?
Thanks in advance,drc
