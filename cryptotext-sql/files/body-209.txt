"dcache" is the name of the L1 cache in this case.

--trace-flags=Cache will give you an idea of what's happening in the
simulation, but the only way to know exactly which stats get updated
when is to look in the source code.  The regStats() method tells you
which fields of an object correspond to stat values, then you can look
in the code to see where they get updated.
