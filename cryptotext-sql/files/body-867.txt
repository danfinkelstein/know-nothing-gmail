Ah thanks for the advice, I see the problem(s) now . Just suprised
that the fetch rate  is much lower than expected .I am pretty new in
this part of M5, so excuse the questions:
However, I am not an expert at all, it seems that theirs really
nothing wrong with M5 (from what I can tell now), and perhaps the IPC
for Blackscholes is really this low. The only other issue at the
moment I can think of is that I did not compile my benchmarks
optimally. Is there any recommended flags to include to compile any
benchmarks into m5?
I basically used the ev67 pre-compiled compiler on the website. I did
not tune for ev5.ev6 or ev4, I noticed those were much slower.
Thanks,
EF
