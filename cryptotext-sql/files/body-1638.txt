I'm currently running Alpha FS with 64 cores without any noticeable
problems. I'm using the tsb_osfpal PAL binary and Linux v2.6.18.  But, I am
not booting the kernel in atomic mode. I use timing mode with simple CPUs to
run experiments and boot the OS, which may not be compatible with the
experiments you're running.

Subject: [m5-users] Linux to simulate 32 and 64 cores?
Hi all,
I am trying to scale a cluster design to use 32 and 64 cores, but when I
fast-forward in atomic mode to get to the  simulation point, I notice
that linux tries to launch all the CPUs up to 63, and then I get:
"smp_call_function_on_cpu: initial timeout -- trying long wait"at which
point linux appears to be waiting for some response and the simulation
waits. Has anyone successfully boot 32 or 64 cores in full system alpha
without experiencing this delightful event? If so, what kernel and
palcode did you use?
Thanks in advance,
Rick
