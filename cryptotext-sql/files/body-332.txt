You have two choices, the first of which is not general.  If you are looking at writebacks from private caches that are associated only with a single core, then you can infer the core IDs of the writebacks based on which cache it came from (but not the PC).  This is not generalizeable if the writebacks you want to track come from shared caches.  If you want the PC in this case, you'll have to save the PC associated with every block when it's inserted into the cache so that you can look at it when it's written back.
If you want to look at writebacks from shared caches, to get the data you want you need to install the information with each block when it inserted into the cache.  That way, when that block is evicted, the information you want is associated with it if it needs to be written back.

thank you very much, Steve.
I understand what you mean. But if I want to track the threadIDs, coreIDs
and PCs from the Writeback instructions(actually Writeback instructions should have those information), what files should I see so that I can make midifications on them?
thanks in advance
