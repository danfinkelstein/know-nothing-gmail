Hello,
   I want to have an accumulator to keep track of a 
particular system property. I need to keep adding values to it of type float. 
Can I use create a scalar stat, and perform float additions to it? 
 
eg:
 
my_stat += <some float value>;
 
Is there a restriction that the stats can only be 
integers?
 
 
Or, is there a way that I can create a global variable of type 
float, add value to it, and output it at the end of the simulation. If golbal 
variables are not possible, is it possible to create static variables, which 
will only init to zero the first time and later on retain their values, which I 
can output at the end of the simulation.
 
any help is greatly appreciated!
 
 
Sujay
