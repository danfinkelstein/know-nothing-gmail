Normally I add a -s to that command line because I want to create checkpoints with the atomic cpu, I restore from the checkpoints immediately into the timing cpu where the caches are warmed up and then I switch to a detailed cpu model. The -w flag has no meaning unless the -s (standard switch) flag is used.
You'll need to modify the scripts a little bit if you want to do anything else. If you want to just transition into a timing cpu and not into a detailed cpu you'll need to change line 64 in Simulation.py from         root.switch_cpus = switch_cpus to       testsys.switch_cpus = switch_cpus and then add some code to alter the atomic warm up period. Alternatively you could use the standard switch code and change the O3 cpu to another timing cpu if you wanted to end up with a simple cpu model that would allow statistics to be collected on the other cpu after the switch over.

I tried using following command line:
build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt configs/example/fs.py  -n 4 -r 1
--timing --caches -w 50000000000, so that it switches
to timing simple cpu only after warming up caches with
atomic simple cpu.
But nothing is happening in console. It is not getting
restored from checkpoint.
I am using system files from version b3.
Can you please forward me the command  line you use
for booting up timing simple cpu.

It's another bug, but since we never really boot
with timing and
caches it's not surprising that we haven't seen it
before.

This could honestly be just because it takes a
long time.  With
timing and caches, the simulator is pretty slow.
This is working if caches option is not used.
But with L1,L2 cache present and with multiple
cpus it
is still getting stuck while booting.
command line used:
build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt configs/example/fs.py  -n 4
--timing --caches --l2cache

There is an issue in b4 with when the CPU ids
get
assigned to CPUs
that can cause some weird behavior in all
multi-processor
configurations (2,3,4, xxx cpus). The attach
patch
fixes those problems.

Yea, you found a bug. I found the changeset

caused the problem,
and I'll try to figure out what is going on
tomorrow and post a patch.
In the future please create a new topic on the

Replying

Timing simple cpu in full system mode in m5
beta
4  is
not booting up. In the console it is getting
stuck
into "NET: Registered protocol family 2" and
is
not
proceeding forward.
System files are from:
http://www.m5sim.org/dist/current/m5_system_2.0b3.tar.bz2
This is happening if 4 cpus are used for
booting.
For
1 cpu it is ok.
