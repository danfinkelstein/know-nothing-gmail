Hi,
 
I was looking in the archieve on how to use the cpu2000.py file for spec2000 benchmarks. Though I found some help from the archieve, I was not able to get results using what was mentioned. I had created the same file structure that was mentioned in the archieves. 
 
Unable to find workload for gzip. This is what that I can see in the .e file when i run it.
 
Any help could be highly appreciated.
Thanks,
 
Satish.
