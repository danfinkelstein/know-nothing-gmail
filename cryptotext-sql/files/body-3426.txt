If you look at configs/common/Simulation.py line 97 you'll see a code
snippet that says
"m5.ticks.setGlobalFrequency(...)"
If you change the parameter to "1ns" you'll get you desired 1 tick per
CPU tick effect
for the default 2GHz CPU.
This is what I do for my simulations to simplify how things look to my eye.
It'd probably be real easy to incorporate a parameter in
configs/example/se.py that takes
in the system global frequency and eventually set the frequency.
The default frequency could be whatever the CPU frequency is or maybe jusT 1ps.
For me, matching it up to the CPU frequency makes the most sense, but maybe
that's because I do mostly Syscall Emulation workloads.
It'd also be cool if you could say "if SE MODE, system-frequency =
clock-frequency, else FS MODE, system-frequency = 1ps"
for the default case...
