Hi Meng-Ju,
This request comes up periodically.  When I developed the stats
package, I intentionally made it so that it wasn't easy to get a stat
value out from C++ because stats can be reset or swapped at almost any
time, making it hard to use these values correctly.  Generally, I tell
people that they should have a normal integer that keeps track of the
value in parallel with the statistic.  In the numCycles case, I think
this already exists (depending on which numCycles of course).
If you really want to get at the value, you'd use numCycles.value().
This isn't quite as dangerous as it used to be, but be careful for
statistics being reset and things like that.
