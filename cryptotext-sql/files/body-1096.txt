Hi All:
    I have a question about how I should extend a cpu model. In the
tutorial on the website, it seems that one has to copy the base.cc and
base.hh files from src/cpu/simple directory and then inherent from
BaseSimpleCPU. I wonder if that copying is necessary, if so why? It
seems just the base.cc and base.hh files are just copied and nothing
is modified to them. Why wouldn't it be ok just to inherent from
BaseSimpleCPU, rather than copying the files and then inherent? Is it
that Scons has some restrictions or some other reason?
    Thank you for any comment in advance.
