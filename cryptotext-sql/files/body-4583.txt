Hi
I am trying to run specweb99 benchmarks with apache running on the server side. Â I tried using "-b SurgeSpecweb", but it seems the latest linux disk image from the website doesn't have necessary files for running apache and also some paths are not set correctly in the spec-surge-server.rcS and spec-surge-client.rcS files. Are these scripts supposed to run with the latest disk image? Am I missing sth here?
Thanks,
-Mojtaba
