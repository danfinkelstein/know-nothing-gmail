Hi Isuru:
  Thanks for your helps. I am doing something like what you are doing.
However, there is no positive result. It is very frustrating. To be
honest I am not only a complete newbie to M5, but also a newbie to
Linux and cross-compiling. I tried to follow the steps provided by
Meng to build a 4.2.x cross-compiler instead of 4.1.0 (default) to
support OpenMP. However, after building the cross-compiler and compile
the benchmark binaries successfully, I found that Meng's multithread
M5 only supports his own threaded APIs, not all threaded applications.
I am not sure that this is the reason I cannot execute the compiled
binaries correctly in M5. Maybe, there are some mistakes when I build
the cross-compiler or binaries.
regards,
  sitos
