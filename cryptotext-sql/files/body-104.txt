Thanks Nate. Correct me if I'm wrong: in file "m5-stable/build/ALPHA_SE/python/m5/objects/__init__.py", all the imports will include the corresponding .py files for each components from src/ directory, and those .py files are the source where I can learn about all the available classes and parameters in script writing, right?

I compiled and run M5 successfully with the given example scripts. However,
the directory "src/python/m5/objects" which is said to contain class
definitions and parameters is missing. I cannot find it in the tarball
neither. Is it generated during compilation? If yes, how can I generated it?
     
Yes, it is generated and it will actually be in the build directory.
It will automatically be generated when you compile m5.
