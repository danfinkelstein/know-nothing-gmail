I'm trying to create a configuration hierarchy between some custom
SimObjects. To simplify things, let's assume I have two custom
SimObjects, called Father and Daughter (to avoid later confusion with
Parent and Child). The python code for Father instantiates a Daughter
and from my C++ code I can do things like father->daughter and
everything is happy. What I'd like to do is add a pointer in the
opposite direction, such that I can use daughter->father in the C++
code.
After a few unsuccessful attempts using "Parent" in the Python code, I'm
now trying to do:
# construct Father
# contruct Daughter
root.daughter.father = root.father
but this results in the configuration parsing code to go into a
recursive loop. Is there a simple way to set up such a pointer?
Thanks,
James
