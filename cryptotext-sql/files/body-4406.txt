Hi,
I've just been reading the under-construction "Defining ISAs" wiki page.
I'm pretty keen to port an ISA we have here in Manchester to M5. The ISA
is pretty similar to Alpha (although its only 32-bit), but has a few
unique additions.
I'm not sure who is responsible for updating the wiki page, but I'd be
happy to act as a guinea pig in testing the instructions.
regards,
Matt Horsnell
