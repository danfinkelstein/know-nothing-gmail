Ali is right. When you change CPU_MODELS, you change what cpu models are
compiled into M5. Then you need to change what cpu model the
configuration script to M5, se.py, tries to use. In the case of se.py,
the -d option tells it to use the detailed cpu. Make sure you put the -d
after se.py on the command line. If you want to see what other options
the se.py script supports, you can pass it the --help option.
