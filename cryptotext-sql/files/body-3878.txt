Please provide as much information about what you're trying to do is as possible, it's really the only way we can help you and prevents large exchanges of e-mails without any resolution.
1. What did you set the parameters to be?
2. Have you tried using a the Physical Memory instead of the DRAM one?
3. What CPU model are you using? If you're using an atomic cpu and haven't change any parameters on it, the access latency it gets back from memory doesn't matter

Can you please tell me where should i change to get
the  effect? I changed in
src/python/m5/objects/PhysicalMemory.py as follows:
"cpu_ratio = Param.Int(10,"ratio between CPU speed and
memory bus speed") "
Also changed "latency = Param.Latency('1ms', "latency
of an access")" but execution time is remaining
exactly same (by execution time i am referring to tick
value difference between program start and end)

Have you looked at the latency settings for the bus
and main memory?
The defaults for these are unreasonably low.  If you
want realistic
results you'll have to modify these parameters to
whatever you believe
to be realistic values.

From trace files it seems that cache hit latency
is
around 1000 ticks to 2000 ticks, but if it misses
then
the latency is ~6000 cycles but not more. Now in
the
simulation there is no L2 so,how come second
latency
which is the memory access latency is so close of
L1
access latency?
