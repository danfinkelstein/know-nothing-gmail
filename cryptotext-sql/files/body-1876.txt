Hi,
I want to use m5 to create a distributed system to test some algorithms
I am developing. The documentation is a bit fragmented regarding this
issue and I am not sure if I understand this correctly.
As I understand it, I can create as many CPUs as I like and connect them
to each other. However, I want to create a distributed system where each
machine can communicate with the other. While reading the fs.py file, I
find that the last couple of lines are
        print "Error I don't know how to create more than 2 systems."
        sys.exit(1)
Does this imply that m5 can only simulate a single client-server
architecture? If not, could you please point me to some documentation
that tells me how to create a distributed system (either full system or
system emulation will do for my purpose). I am interested in a way of
creating a system connected by Ethernet (preferably switched). Thanks in
advance.
yours,
Sherif Fadel
