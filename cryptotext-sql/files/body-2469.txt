I;m using the example that comes with the M5 simulator, the one that it's in that configs/example/se.py, If I'm not wrong that one uses the SimpleAtomicCPU, is there any way that the M5 simulator can show me a little of feedback of the simulation, number of cycles or how many of the simulation lefts. Thank you.- Show quoted text -

That's easily possible.  Depending on which CPU model you use, you can
expect something like 1000x slowdown for SimpleAtomicCPU to 50000x
slowdown for O3CPU.
