Just create an account on the wiki (http://m5sim.org) and create a new
page titled "SpecOMP".  It should hopefully be pretty easy for you.
We probably also need a workloads page that we can link it to, and
probably link the workloads page to running m5, but we can take care
of this if you don't want to.
