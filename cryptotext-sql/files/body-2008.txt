Dear Meng-Ju Wu,
Thanks for the link. I download the patch and started doing as instructed and
got some questions.
1. The M5 version Jiayuan Meng is using is beta 4. Therefore I tried to pop all
the patches and update it to new M5 version. But I got some errors. Below is the
terminal output. Please advice me how to resolve that.

on the list.

2. Thereafter I tried to work in the old version. Then I followed all the steps
given by Jiayuan Meng. When I try to do step 7, make compile, first it gives an
error saying cannot locate scons.py. Then I change the make file to execute
scons directly. Then aganin got an error. The terminal output is follows.
build/ALPHA_SE/smp/mtsimplecpu.cc: In member function ‘void
MTSimpleCPU::updateThreadInvolvement()’:
build/ALPHA_SE/smp/mtsimplecpu.cc:120: error: ‘long long’ invalid for ‘elapse’
build/ALPHA_SE/smp/mtsimplecpu.cc:120: error: ‘long long’ invalid for ‘type name’
cc1plus: warnings being treated as errors
build/ALPHA_SE/sim/host.hh: At global scope:

build/ALPHA_SE/arch/alpha/isa_traits.hh:164: warning:
‘AlphaISA::SyscallPseudoReturnReg’ defined but not used
scons: *** [build/ALPHA_SE/smp/mtsimplecpu.do] Error 1
scons: building terminated because of errors.
It would be great if you could advice me how to overcome these problems. This is
a great help
Thanks and regards,
Isuru
