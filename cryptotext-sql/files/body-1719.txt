Hi all,
I am wondering if there has any way to disable some statistics
recorded in the m5stats.txt.  Basically, I don't want to go into every
file and mask out the related codes. Could I set up something when
registering the statistic counter, then m5 will not print this counter
into the m5stats.txt? I needs this because when I use the large scale
CMP configuration, the m5stats.txt is more than 100MBytes.
Thanks,
Meng-Ju
