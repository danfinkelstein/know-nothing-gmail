Hi,
I am in the early stages of working with m5, and am trying to better understand
the EXTRAS option. I did read this thread: http://www.mail-archive.com/m5-
users@m5sim.org/msg02395.html, and found it very helpful.
I have thus far tried compiling two basic modules using the EXTRA option. The
first, eio traces, worked as per the instructions. The second is from your m5
ASPLOS tutorial--http://www.m5sim.org/dist/tutorials/asplos_pres.pdf,
HelloDevice.
When I try to compile it, I get an import error:
**ImportError: No module named Device
This originates from the call in HelloDevice.py,
**from Device import BasicPioDevice
What confuses me is that eio has a similar declaration,
**from Process import Process
Other than adding
**from m5.proxy import *
to HelloDevice.py (to make it similar to EioProcess.py), it is identical to
that in the ASPLOS tutorial. The other files are also very similar and should
work:
hello.cc has
**#include "hello.hh" instead of
**#include "dev/hello.hh" because I am including it using the extras option and
do not want to directly mess with the source.
I am using m5 2.0, beta 6
To compile, I run:
**scons build/custom_ALPHA_SE/m5.opt EXTRAS=moeng-extra/eio -- works
**scons build/custom_ALPHA_SE/m5.opt EXTRAS=moeng-extra/hello_device -- doesn't
work
Any help is much appreciated,
Michael Moeng
