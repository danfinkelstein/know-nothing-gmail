Thanks Steve. What about --fast-forward. How does that impact the MP workload. Is there a way to set a simpoint for each cpu?I don't know about those offhand... I haven't used them myself.  I'm sure that it's feasible but it probably involves hacking on the Python script.
 
Also, sometimes I want to terminate the simulation because it takes forever to finish and send SIGINTP (signal 2) to m5. Sometimes it prints the statistics while sometimes it exits without printing any statistics. Any idea?
It should always dump statistics when you exit, because of this line in src/python/simulate.py:  atexit.register(internal.stats.dump)There may be an issue if you send it two SIGINTs where the second one interrupts the stats dump or something like that.  Or maybe there's a raace condition, I don't know.  You can dump stats without terminating the simulation by sending SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2 (see src/sim/main.cc).
