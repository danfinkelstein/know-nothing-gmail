hiI am running eight-core system simulation for integer benchmarks. But i am getting some 0 values for some cores in m5stat.txt.After  exchanging the benchmarks to different cpu's I am getting the results. What might be the problem I don't understand. So please help me out regarding this problem.
Thanks HARI
