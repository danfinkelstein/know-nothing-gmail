Hello,
     I am trying to get Spec2K to run. 
(beta 4 or 5)  I have attached my example config script here, which tries 
to run only the gzip_log benchmark. I get the following error:
 
> ./build/ALPHA_SE/m5.opt 
configs/spec2000/test2.py -b gzip
 
M5 compiled Feb 18 2008 17:51:36M5 started Mon Mar 24

configs/spec2000/test2.py -b gzipGlobal frequency set at 1000000000000 ticks

system at all!panic: only one workload allowed @ cycle 
0[create:build/ALPHA_SE/cpu/simple/atomic.cc, line 817]Program aborted 
at cycle 0>
 
It seems  the workload is not being assigned correctly, 
but I am not able to figure out why. The line in atomic.cc which issues the 
panic is:
 
#if FULL_SYSTEM    
params->profile = profile;    params->do_quiesce = 
do_quiesce;    params->do_checkpoint_insts = 
do_checkpoint_insts;    params->do_statistics_insts = 
do_statistics_insts;#else    if (workload.size() != 
1)        panic("only one workload 
allowed");    params->process = 
workload[0];#endif
So maybe the workload.size() is not evaluating 
correctly.
 
Can someone help me out?
 
Thanks,
Sujay
