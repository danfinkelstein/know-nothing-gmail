I attach my script file, the result of tracediff with timing and detailed,call stack and final part of instruction traces from both timing and detailed model. Looks like detailed is executing instructions tice and at different ticks but if we ignore these two factores, the results of tracediff are very similar.
You missed an important detail on the tracediff command line: you want
to run "Exec,-ExecTicks" (note the hyphen/minus sign in there) not
"Exec,ExecTicks".  By default Exec by itself prints the tick numbers
(as you see) but if you add "-ExecTicks" it suppresses that so that
tracediff can actually pinpoint where the execution diverges.
As Gabe says, the tricky part once you've done that is figuring out
"when" things go wrong on the detailed side, but you do have the line
number of the diff from tracediff and can then rerun just the detailed
version with ticks enabled to see what tick you're at at the relevenat
line of the trace.  I use combination of "head" and "tail" for that,
though as Gabe says a simple perl script works too.
