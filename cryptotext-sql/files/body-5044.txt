Hi Dan,     I didn't solve that problem. But I got another machine which could pass link period. So I am going both ways.     But Steve also mentioned his method. For him, it was because his disk was full. But that couldn't solve my problem.     Hope you could finally find the solution.     Regards,     ChenjieDaniel Alex Finkelstein <dfinke01@cis.poly.edu> wrote:    Hi Chenjie,    I think I might be having the same link error -- if the error is against python2.4. For some reason the online archive of the mailing list has stripped your thread of all the useful information, so if it's not a hassle could you let me know if you had the same
 problem and how you solved it if you did?    Thanks,  Dan    --  Daniel Alex Finkelstein  Graduate Research Fellow  Computer & Information Science  Polytechnic University  6 MetroTech
