I'm using swig 1.3.31 and gcc version 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5465)
This is the function that error refers to:
template <class Type>
struct traits_as<Type, value_category> {
 static Type as(PyObject *obj, bool throw_error) {
   Type v;
   int res = asval(obj, &v);
   if (!obj || !SWIG_IsOK(res)) {
     if (!PyErr_Occurred()) {
       SWIG_Error(SWIG_TypeError,  swig::type_name<Type>());
     }
     if (throw_error) throw std::invalid_argument("bad type");
   }
   return v;
 }
};
I managed to get it to compile without error by just going changing the line to:
Type v=0;
but I'm not sure where or what the swig interface files are. I simply edited swig's source output.
Recompiling in debug mode doesn't have the problem, only building opt mode.

My first guess is that it's some issue with SWIG/gcc. What version of gcc and swig are you using? Swig should be generating code that gcc doesn't complain about, however that is not always the case. The other option is that the error is resulting from some optimization that exposes a bug in our code. Do you get the same error if you compile a debug build?
What is the  source code to the swig::Py_Sequence_Ref<T>::operator T() function in build/ALPHA_SE/params/params_wrap.cc? My version doesn't have a variable v in it.
You could compile the source without -Werror and the build would complete since it's only a warning and not an error.

After going through and changing python parameters references to use the "const <object>Params *p" format in the constructor, and removing the preprocessor python things at the bottom of the file, I'm getting the following compile error:

scons: *** [build/ALPHA_SE/params/params_wrap.o] Error 1
scons: building terminated because of errors.
Can anyone shed some light on what may be going wrong here? The simulator compiled fine before I tried to transfer over this custom object, but I'm not familiar with swig so am unsure how to go about finding the source of this problem.
