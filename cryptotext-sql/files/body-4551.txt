Just to follow up... These patches and scripts worked beautifully in simple CPU!  Ron - you are a lifesaver.  I managed to get all of the data that I needed for the project that I was working on.  I'm not sure I would have made the deadline had it not been for your help.
For anyone else having trouble with Splash2 in SE, give these patches and scripts a try.Regards,-Edith- Show quoted text -On 4/23/07, Ronald George Dreslinski Jr

Edith,Although I have moved to running Splash2 in FS, I still have the SEversion of the v1-splash-alpha.tgz working for simple CPUs.  I haveincluded in this email a configuration script to run the benchmarks.  You
will have to point the rootdir parameter to the precompiled splash2directory you downloaded.  The other file attached is a diff that enablesthe threads to be scheduled properly.  However, it currently will break
any SMT cores in the system and I have not verified that it works with theO3 cpu.So in short, if you want to run with simple CPUS, you can use the diffattached and the configuration file attached along with the precompiled
splash2 benchmarks on the m5 website to run them in SE mode.  If you wantO3 cpu support you may have to make the proper changes to the initalthread state of each CPU as was done for the simpleCPU in the diff.
Please let me know if you have any difficulty getting them to run.  Theconfig file has several different preset flags you can use to set thesize/latencies of L1 and L2 caches as well as the speed and number of
cores.  The diff I have given here is from the beta3 release that shouldbe available shortly, although it should work with the beta2 as well, linenumbers may not line up, I haven't tried it.example command line:
%: build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug run.py -n2 --rootdir="./splash2/codes"--benchmark=FMMOf course you will need to point the rootdir at your version.-RonOn Sun, 22 Apr 2007, Edith Hand wrote:
