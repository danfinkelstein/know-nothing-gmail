Thanks for your reply~
My G++ version is 4.2.4.
The SWIG version is 1.3.29
However, I have successfully built M5 on another machine with G++ 4.1.1
If you still need my core_wrap.cc, please let me know.
By the way, the release note mentioned that M5-2.0b6 supports gcc 4.3 or
upper.
Does it mean that we can run the benchmark compiled by gcc 4.3 cross
compiler on M5 FS mode?
I have built my own cross compiler using gcc 4.2.4 with the crosstool.
However, the executable could not correctly run on the M5-2.0b5 FS mode.
Could you provide the gcc 4.2 (or 4.3) cross compiler which could correctly
compile on the website?
Thanks again!!
Dennis

You can certainly remove the -Werror.  I'd like to know more if
possible. What version of G++?  What version of swig?  Can you send me
a copy of core_wrap.cc?
Thanks,
  Nate
