Thanks Steve. Simulation works fine if block sizes are equal at all cache levels. It is a pity that M5 does not support different block sizes...
By the way, in cache statistics, I should look at the "overall" accesses/misses/accesses, right?

change the cache size without changing the block size?
I realize that some real machines have different block sizes at
different cache levels, but that's not officially supported in M5, so
I wouldn't be surprised if having different block sizes is the source
of your problem.

1) I am using the latest version and I did not change anything other than
the cache size.
2) For the default case, I use 32B block size for L1 and 64B for L2. It
works fine. The errors are produced due to change in cache size. I did not
change block size. Furthermore, it is common for L2 to have a larger block
size than L1
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks.

Just changing cache sizes should not affect the results.  Are you
using the latest m5 from the development repository?  Have you changed
anything other than the cache sizes?
I noticed you said the default L1 cache is 32B, but the default block
size is 64, and all caches must use the same block size.

Hi all,
I'm trying to run selected benchmarks from MiBench in M5. The system is
configured into multi-core (CMP) mode with each core has its own L1
caches
and all cores share a unified L2 cache. Each core is assigned a different
benchmark. However, I found the following error:
When I use the L1 cache configuration of (32kB, 2 assoc, 32B) and L2 of
(4MB, 8 assoc, 64B), which are the default values, everything is OK.
However, when I try to change the cache configuration, for example, L1
with
a size of 8kB and L2 with 128kB or L1 with 16kB and L2 with 1MB, the
simulation terminates with the error:
0: system.remote_gdb.listener: listening for remote gdb on port 7000
0: system.remote_gdb.listener: listening for remote gdb on port 7001
panic: Tried to execute unmapped address 0.

Am I missing something?
Thanks.
