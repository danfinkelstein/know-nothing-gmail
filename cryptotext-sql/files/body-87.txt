The GHB, prefetching mechanism works fine in all cases.
Another problem that i am currently facing is as follow:
There are only integers and floating point numbers in the application that
i am trying to run.
Check the mailing list archives but I'm not sure Floating Point support is
all the way there for x86. I'll let someone else chime in.
This is a good point if you're doing floating point. Make sure you compile to use SSE instead of x87, and then it should pretty much work. This is independent of your block size problem, though.
