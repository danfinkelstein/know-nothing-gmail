Hi Yinglong,
It certainly is possible, however the ease of measurement and effort
required depend on a few things. Are you planning on modifying the
linux scheduler or running your own scheduler? If the prior then
everything should work immediately, although it will be more difficult
to modify and capturing statistics on all the processors will be more
difficult as well. If you plan to use your own scheduler within M5, no
one has done that, however someone recently got pthreads (where the
number of threads < number of processors) working in M5 syscall
emulation mode. I think their patches should make it into the
repository soon.
