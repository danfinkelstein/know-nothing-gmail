Starting with a wiki would be fantastic, maybe something like an "M5
Cookbook".  If things are useful, we can incorporate them.  I plan to
work on improving the regression framework, so we could possibly
provide a mechanism for adding cookbook stuff to the regressions,
though failures would go to the owners of each recipe.  This would be
a few months away at the earliest though.
