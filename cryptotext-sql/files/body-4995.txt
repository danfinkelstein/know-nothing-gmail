Hi,     I will try to answer this. Please correct me if you see something incorrect.     To run your own program you need to have a run.py file and a Benchmarks.py file.         1) Examples of run.py files are in m5-test directory. Choose a simple run.py, make a copy of it ( so that you dont ruin the original). Now in the run.py file change the workload to the name of your own C program ( the run.py files in the test directory will already have some test workload, just change that)  e-g cpu0.workload = Benchmarks.ammp()        2) Now the run.py will call the Benchmarks.py file. Make the Benchmark.py file (you can find examples of that as well If you look in the m5-test
 directory. It specifies the available tests.) Modify that file and write the command line for your own C program.     3) Make sure all of these are in the same directory, now run the command line   >m5.opt run.py and the simulation will start running.     Ofcourse this is just an example for 1st time running the m5 with your program. Using the already given run.py as a start. Once you get the idea of how everything is run, you can creat your own, more detailed run.py files.      Any further details can be found at  http://m5.eecs.umich.edu/wiki/index.php/Running_M5     Regards,     Bushra

I have installed m5_1.1 and have been successful in running in Splash2 benchmarks by downloading them.      I have also downloaded crosstool and have also compiled my cross-compiler. I have written a small program in C and have generated my Alpha binary using the cross compiler. It would be of great help if someone can tell me the steps I have follow to run this program on the m5 simulator.       regards-  Rajdeep          Talk is cheap.
