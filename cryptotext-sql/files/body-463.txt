  
Hi,
I didn't look into the details of the source of this message. Anyway,
you can stop the simulation by just waiting until the simulated binary
stops execution or by using <Ctrl>+C. The stats-file will be made
even if you interrupt the simulator.
Another way for early interupting the simulator is by defining the
maximum instruction count of all threads via the python config script.
Just give the parameter max_insts_any_thread of system.cpu[i] a value
(with "i" each number of processors that you've defined).
I hope this could be usefull..
Please note that this counts for ALPHA_SE and I'm not totally sure it
will be the same for ALPHA_FS.

Hi All,
  
I am successfully able to run m5 in ALPHA_FS Mode and connected with it
using m5term on 3456.
  
However, I stopped the m5 simulation in the terminal by sending
terminating signal to the runing process using <Ctrl>+C 
and I got a message 
  
  "hack:be nice to actually delete the event here"
  
Please can anyone let me know if this is the correct way of stop the
simulator and there is some other way I should do it.
  
Regards,
