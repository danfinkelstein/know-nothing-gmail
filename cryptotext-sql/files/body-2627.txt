I believe that it should be flushed before the simulator exits since
it is exiting cleanly.  Currently, python and C++ are not properly
synchronized, so there can be a strange interleaving between them (fix
in my tree).  In python, you can do sys.stdout.flush.  In C++, you can
do cout.flush() or cout << flush.  endl also causes a flush, and it is
what \n translates to in a cprintf.

What unconditional printf?  A print in python main()?  Is it something
you've inserted?
