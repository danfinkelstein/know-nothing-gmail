Hi, We need to make some modifications to the Alpha ISA and insert a few more instructions. But while compiling a program through crosscompiler, we need to let the cross compiler know about the new instructions. I guess we need to modify the assembler code of gcc for that. 
Could someone help us about how to do this and is there any other way? -- Pritha Ghoshal
