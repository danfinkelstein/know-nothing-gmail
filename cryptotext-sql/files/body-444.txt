hi all,
i see the M5's cache replace policy of LRU, it seems that it will
always choose from the tail of the LRU list and if it's valid block
then refresh the relevant stats parameters? but i have a doubt that
most modern systems will consider the invalid blocks when looking for
blocks for allocating. if there're no invalid blocks then go to the LRU
list and choose from the tail. Is M5 violating this mechanism? or I
miss something?
Thanks,
Sheng
