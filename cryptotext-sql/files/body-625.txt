            What code are you referring to?  The scoreboard.cc and scoreboard.hh class in cpu/o3 is currently used. The O3 CPU has some basis on the published details of the EV6 processors, but only loosely. I can't say for certain if implementing the scoreboard as it was intended to be will help with serializing instructions.
            
            I hope this clears things up for you,

                Hello,
                It seems there is code in M5, that was written for a scoreboard class. From what I can tell, it is not in use, is this correct?
                
                I am assuming that this scoreboard was intended to be the EV6 scoreboard explained in the Alpha EV6 manual?
                
                Due to serializing instructions being very apparent in PARSEC benchmarks, there needs to be some solution to reduce the impact of these instructions. The first solution I believe is to implement the scoreboard as it was intended to be. I suspect for a wide machine we can gain 10% preformance which might be the best we can get in using the ALPHA ISA (pretty out dated).
                
                Thanks,
                EF
