Hello all,How does one change cpu pipeline parameters such as Fetchwidth or Decodewidth? Which files should be edited? I tried looking for it but I couldn't find it. I found params.hh in m5/build/ALPHA_SE/cpu/o3 where the parameters are listed but I doubt that that's it since the parameters were only declared and not defined. Are these parameters determined at the C++ level, or does it come from the Python level?
Thanks!
