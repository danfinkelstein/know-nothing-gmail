This is SE or FS mode? ...
Hmmmm, I kind of feel like this is a reoccurring problem since I
remember a mailing list thread way way back when Ron was real active
on M5 saying that he switched the threads to start off at Unallocated
to get SPLASH to work for O3.  However, it's tagged and not fixed yet
as a bug report so I believe the flyspray thread captures the problem
appropriately...
The fixes would be:
(1) switch the thread to start off as Unallocated and edit
activateWhenReady to handle this case now.
(2) switch over from SimpleCPU ...
I think you can edit the activate() function like you say and
alleviate the problem.
And on another end, this kind of motivates me the need to roll through
SMT regression tests back into M5 because without that
we can't really "re-prove" code works or not after subtle changes to
M5 inevitably happens...
Until I can get that pushed, then I'm happy to help on bug fixes...
I need to try to recreate your bug and look closely at it before I can
give further advice.
