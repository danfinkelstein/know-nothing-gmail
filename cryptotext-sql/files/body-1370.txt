Thanks. How does the latency calculated in dram.cc translate to actual latency? Is the latency calculated (which is of type int) in terms of system clock cycles, or cpu clock cycles, or something else?
Currently, I get lat values between 25 to 60, most of the times.

I did; it's earlier in this thread (a posting from me just about a day ago).

How did you do the random latency hack? Could you post the code?
