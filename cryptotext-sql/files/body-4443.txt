I would imagine that the libpython2.5.so that you grabbed from the rpm requires a different version of glibc than the one that you have. It's normally a very bad plan to extract libraries from a package and install them manually because you might be missing some dependencies. Since you already compiled and installed python 2.5 you should probably delete the libpython2.5.so files that you installed manually and then reconfigure python with ./configure --enable-shared and then rebuild it and reinstall it. That should create  working version of libpython. If all goes well the python binary should link against the libpython and work just fine.

Thanks Ali,
     the Python.h is located in the /usr/local/include/python2.5/ directory and then I made a softlink to the /usr/include/python2.5/ directory just in case the compiler will look into that directory. I still got the same error.
These are the contents of the file build/scons_config.log, i really do not know what to do with the 'undefined reference' messages at the bottom part, does this mean I have to rebuild my glibc? If yes, how? can you please point me to some useful websites as a starting point. thanks again. =)
