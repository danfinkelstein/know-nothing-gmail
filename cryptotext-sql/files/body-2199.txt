Did you say whether you had changed anything other than the benchmark
you're trying to run?  What happens if you don't specify a benchmark
at all (which should just bring you to a console prompt)?  From the
system.terminal output you showed before it looks like the error is
happening before you get that far.
If it's true that you can't even boot to a prompt with the unmodified
source code, kernel, and disk image from our web site, then it must be
something in your build environment.  Do you have access to an older
version of gcc?  I use 4.2.4 and have no problems.  I believe others
are using gcc 4.3 though, so I'm skeptical that that's it.
