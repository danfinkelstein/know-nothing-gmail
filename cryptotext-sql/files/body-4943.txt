Hi Steve,
I would like to make one thing clear.
Do the following lines -
stest1 = Benchmarks.stest1()
cpu[0].workload = stest1
cpu[1].workload = stest1
mean that the two different threads of the program
stest1 will run on two cores cpu[0] and cpu[1]
respectively ? Or does it mean that a single copy of
the program will run on two different CPUs where each
CPU runs both the threads ?
Also, if I have a 4 threaded program and two cores,
then how should I run it  ?
Regards-
Rajdeep
