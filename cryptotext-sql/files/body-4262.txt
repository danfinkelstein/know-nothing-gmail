Hi Vilias,
You can use the registerExitCallback() function to register a function that is called when the simulation is about to terminate (search in the code for some examples).

Hello all --
(I feel like I or someone else has asked this before, but I can't seem to find it in the archives.)
Does M5 call a specific function at the end of simulation (similar to the calls to regStats() at the beginning of simulation) for cleanup code?  I need to do some additional processing at the end of simulation (before stats are calculated and printed) and was wondering if there's a standard place I can put my code.  I can't seem to find anything like this in the code or documentation, but thought I may be missing something.
Thanks,
   -Vilas
