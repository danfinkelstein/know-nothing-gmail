Hi Rick,
looks like the activity count went to 0. In the O3, if the activity
count is 0 it will sleep the CPU until something wakes it up.
I'm thinking that usually what happens is that if the CPU is waiting
for a long cache miss, it will just sleep the CPU and then when the
cache event completes it will update the activity count.
Maybe what's happening is the ITB miss happens, but then it never gets
to the code in fetch where the activity count is updated, thus
sleeping the CPU indefinitely...???
