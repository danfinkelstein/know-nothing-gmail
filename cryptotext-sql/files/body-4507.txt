Hey all,
 
When I am trying to test the scalability of M5, I ran the splash2 FFT benchmark with 16 cores.  M5 will prints out
 
fatal: Out of memory, please increase size of physical memory.
 
and then stop the simulation. I don’t know how this could happen since obviously FFT is not that data intensive.
My questions are:
   1. Do you have any clue about what happened?
   2. in SE mode, does M5 support page swapping?  If I have a 128M
      physical memory and I am running 16 threads, each of them allocate
      more than 8M memory space in the process’s VIRTUAL address space,
      how does M5 handle this situation in SE mode?
You've pretty much answered your own question there... since there's no OS in SE mode, there's no paging, so if your program tries to allocate more space than the physical memory you've allocated it gives you the error message you see above.  Even if the FFT program itself doesn't allocate that much, the system does allocate a certain amount of memory per thread for stack space (I don't recall how much... it could be 8MB).  That's why you may run out as you increase the number of threads even without changing the program.
Fortunately it should be easy to fix; as the message says, just increase the physical memory size parameter in the configuration file.

Thanks!
