Hi,I'm not sure simply looking into the IQ will do the trick, since it's out of order there's no telling that just because an instruction is in the queue in a certain order, that it is executed in that order.
What's complicating what you are asking is that an O3 processor executes more than 1 instruction a a time. Thus, a question for you to ask yourself is what happens if an ALU op is executed on the same cycle as a memory operation? Consequently, hard to quantify what a "stream" is  when superscalar machines operate on things concurrently.
So if all you need is "many non-memory instructions are executed between any two memory operations" and dont compare about instruction latency, then Why not track this on a simpler CPU model like AtomicSimpleCPU, use a trace flag like Exec, and then gather your stats. There's documentation on m5sim.org to find help.
If the O3 is what you need, you want to be able to track when instructions are executed as well as maybe IQ interaction. The IQ is straightforwardly located in a file called inst_queue.hh. It's primarily used in the Rename (rename_impl.hh) or IEW stage of the O3 code (iew_impl.hh).  Also memory operations are in the LSQ section of the code. Browse through there since you'll want to know where an instruction is executed and also where an memory operation is sent out....- Show quoted text -

Hi,
How do I peek into the instruction queue? Basically, I want to get a
trace that shows the entire stream of instructions (i.e both memory
and "regular" instructions). That's because I need to know how many
non-memory instructions are executed between any two memory operations.
Thanks,
Felix
