Hi all,
 
I was using SE mode doing simulation and I want to 
try FS mode. After reading those related documents I still have some 
questions.
 
(1). About getting the binaries to the disk image. If I 
want to add some other benchmarks to disk image. Do I have to create a 
new disk image including those added benchmarks, or I can add the 
benchmarks' binaries directly to existing disk image?
(2) About the precompiled splash benchmark in the 
download page. After I uncompress the downloaded file I found there is only one 
file, shouldn't it have multiple benchmarks' binaries? How can I use this only 
one file?
 
Thanks in advance!
 
Fei
