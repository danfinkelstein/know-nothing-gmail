Hi Paul,
Now your question makes a lot more sense. The bus model was re-written
for 2.0 since the memory system was completely overhauled and the old
bus model would no longer work. What started as me hacking together
something to start testing things grew into the final product with the
help of a few others. Unfortunately, the statistics for the bus never
got added, but I'm glad that you're considering adding some.
First M5 creates a separate bus object for each bus in the system, so
you don't need to know what bus the data is flowing across, observing
the calls is all you need to do.  As long as you keep the proper
statistics they'll be printed out in the stats file as <bus name>
<statistic> <value>. M5 support two different memory modes http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Memory_System
  so you'll need to record statistics for both the atomic and timing
modes (recvAtomic and recvTiming + other timing functions).
The statistics package makes recording the actual data very easy. Take
a look at http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Using_the_Statistics_Package
  and then look at some objects that use statistics for some example
about how this is done. The caches are a pretty complex example, but
the simple cpu (src/cpu/simple) or the etherlink (src/dev/etherlink*)
are probably reasonable examples.
