Hi everyone,
   I have a multithreaded program running on m5-2.0b3 in full system mode. I can get the m5stats.txt which includes the statistics for each core. Is there anybody who can tell me how to get the statistics for each thread instead of each core by configuring m5?
There isn't any way we've implemented to do this. If you enable the traceflag Thread you should see when the kernel thread info struct changes from one thread to another thread, but this information isn't connected into the statistics code at the moment. You would have to make some modifications for it to work. Take a look at arch/alpha/linux/* for more information about how we figure out what thread/pid/process name is running.
  Another problem is I found there are two frequency for simulator.One is 1THz for system and the other is 2GHz for CPU. But in the statistics file CPU and system have the nearly same cycle counts.So could you please why different clock frequency are used?
We simulate the system at 1THz so you don't have to have all devices in the system be some multiple of the CPU frequency. I don't believe there is a cycle count attached to a system, only to CPUs.  Do you have an example? Both parameters are configurable.
