Looking at your error, it looks like that you may have forgot to
include "MyCPU" correctly in the cpu_models.py file.
Does that file include this snippet?:
"CpuModel('MyCPU', 'mycpu_exec.cc',
 '#include "cpu/mycpu/mycpu.hh"',
 { 'CPU_exec_context': 'MyCPU' })"
Also, what's the actual source code line in mycpu_exec.cc 5693 and 5701?
