As the comment in trace_cpu.cc and hh says, "Uses a memory trace to
drive the provided memory hierarchy."  I don't think this code even
compiles anymore, but that's what it once did.  We've done some more
work on feeding traces to m5 recently so we probably could commit some
working code if you need it.
There's no built-in facility for generating traces from m5, though
it's not hard to add.  The details have been discussed on this list in
the not too distant past.
