Glad it worked... thanks for following up.  That I/O bridge doesn't exist in SE mode so that's why this only shows up with Linux.  Hard to say about real systems... in some cases because a real system design has a hard limit on the number of cores then it is practical to simply design buffering in for the worst case and not worry about specific flow control problems.
In any case, though m5 has its unrealistic aspects, I'm pretty confident that it has fewer of those than your average academic simulator.  Sadly I can't promise that the ones it does have are irrelevant to whatever you're doing...

Thanks. It was the bridge connected b/w iobus and membus. For a true system evaluation I believe flow-control should be modeled but I guess people just publish data with whatever they have got, anyway thats another story.
