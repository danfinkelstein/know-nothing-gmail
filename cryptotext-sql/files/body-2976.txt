Crosstools do support gcc 4 now. I have a 4.1.1 cross compiler (that has been posted on the website assuming you have an x86/64 host to run it on) that I use on a daily basis to compile binaries for use in ALPHA_FS.

Hi,
I am trying to port some application written with pthread and OpenMP library on to M5 FS simulator.
However, the documentation mentioned that the crosstool do not support gcc 4.
Could I use other cross compiler which support gcc 4.2 to compiler these application into ALPHA executable to run in FS mode?
Or if I can find a alpha machine (or virtual machine) to do the compilation work?
Thanks a lot~
