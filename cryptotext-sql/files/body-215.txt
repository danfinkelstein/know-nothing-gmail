Hi all,
I was digging a little bit in the implementations of your branch predictors and I think I bumped into a small bug (which might affect performance of the target machine a lot):
Around line 108 in cpu/pred/tournament.cc:
    threshold = (1 << (localCtrBits - 1)) - 1;
    threshold = threshold / 2;
Shouldn't this be
    threshold = (1 << (localCtrBits - 1)) - 1;
?
When you take localCtrBits=2 for example, the threshold should be 1, not 0.
Regards,
Max
