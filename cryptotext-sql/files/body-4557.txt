Hi all,
 
I am a starter on M5, and I'm interested in simulating a 
multithreaded program on a CMP architecture. My question is, can M5 run programs 
written with pthreads? what crosscompiler do you recommend to compile C or C++ 
code on a x86 host to SPARC/ALPHA binaries that can be run on M5?
 
I tried to compile helloworld code on UltraSparc IIIi/SunOS 
using gcc version 3.3.6. However, the sparc binary generates faults when the 
code is run on M5. Would you please give me some hints?
 
Thanks!
 
Jiayuan
