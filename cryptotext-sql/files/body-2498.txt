Ali and Steve:
 
            
Thanks a lot for take your timing to answer my question.  Actually , I am a 
little confused. The Alpha cpu2000 benchmarks are download from internet for 
simplescalar, and they works well on my previous  simplescalar works. As you just said, it may be compiled on OSF/1 
system., does that mean  I can  fix this problem by re-compiling the 
benchmark with crosscompiler for alpha myself?
 
           Thanks 
again, I am really appreciate your help to continue my research!
