Hey all,
 
If you are interested in running a multi-threaded program in
SE mode with shared memory CMP, here is my patch for it. Currently, only alpha
linux binaries are supported. Hope it benefits the M5 community.

Thank Steve, Ali, and all M5 group for their great support
in helping me going through tons of problems.
