Hello,
       I am having trouble 
declaring my own vector stats in the new beta 4 version of M5. for example, if I 
declare:
 
Stats::Vector<> mem_row_access;
 
in dram.hh.
 
Compiling goes through corrctly, no errors. However, when I 
run a benchmark (i am using SE mode), it aborts immediately with the following 
error:
 
panic: stat check failed for  @ cycle 0
 
-------------
 
This worked perfectly in M5 v2 beta 3.
 
Also, using my own scalar stats in beta 4 is working fine. 
There seems to be some problem with vector stats.
