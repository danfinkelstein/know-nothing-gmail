There is a significant number of switches between 0 and 31 (IPL level),I am guessing 0 is User mode, but i have no clue why we are at ipl 31. According to the Alpha Arch Ref Manual II-A around 6-20. IPL 31 is hardware level machine check error, I have no clue why we would enter this mode in a software alpha emulator. Is it possible there is a bug in the alpha cross compiler?
Any Ideas?Thanks,EF- Show quoted text -On Thu, Feb 18, 2010 at 10:00 PM, ef <snorlaxgb@gmail.com> wrote:
