Thanks Nate. Your suggestion fixed the problem. I used swig 1.3.40 to build M5 and the build was successful.

This is a swig problem.  I haven't yet had confirmation as to which
version actually causes this problem, but if you upgrade to at least
1.3.31, I believe that it solves this problem.  I'm just going to
update the webpage and make this the minimum version.
