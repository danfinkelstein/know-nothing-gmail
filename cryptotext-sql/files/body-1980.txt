Hello Veydan,
I have the same problem compiling the Splash-2 for alpha. I hope some
can help. Regarding your first mail in this message
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.m5.users/2793/match=splash+2+precompiled
It says that the precompiled binaries does not work on alpha. It seems
for your second mail that you could not compile for alpha, so do not
expect that those binaries are going to work in FS.
Any ideas reagarding the error of :
../../../../../parmacs.upc.3/pthreads/libparmacs_pthreads.a: could not
read symbols: Archive has no index; run ranlib to add one
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [OCEAN] Error 1
Thank you.
