Hi all,
 
I have two questions.
(1). I am using the Statistics Package to get the memory 
access time and number in bus.cc. I use several vector statistics, like 
below.
 
Stats::Scalar<> 
totalMemoryAccessTime;Stats::Vector<> 
memoryAccessTime; Stats::Vector<> memoryAccessNum;
Stats::Vector<> icacheAccessNum;
Stats::Vector<> nonOverlappingTime;
 
For the first 4 statistics, it works fine and I can get 
the right number when the simulation finishes. However, the vector statistics "nonOverlappingTime" get 
very large numbers. 
I assign the new value to nonOverlappingTime[i] every 
time when this is a new request come back from main memory. And I 
traced the value of  nonOverlappingTime[i] before and after I assign 
the new value, and found that for the first few requests the 
nonOverlappingTime[i]  values are right. 
Then when a nonOverlappingTime[i] is assigned a new value, 
it becomes a very large number, like below.
 
1153750: system.membus: nonOverlappingTime[0]_before: 
9659001153750: system.membus: newAccessTime[0]:1012750, 
nonOverlappingTime[0]_after: 1.01275e+06
 
So I assigned the value of newAccessTime[0] to 
nonOverlappingTime[0], but I got a wrong number. 
I also want to mention that there is no such problem 
in  the 2.0 beta5.  So does any one know how to fix this 
problem?
 
(2)Another problem is that I use 
pkt->req->getCpuNum() in bus.cc to get the requests' CPU id. But it does 
not return the right number. In beta5, it returns 0. In beta 
6, sometimes it returns the right number, the other time it returns 
0.
 
Thanks in advance!
 
Fei
