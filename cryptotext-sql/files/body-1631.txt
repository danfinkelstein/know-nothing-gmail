Thanks I read through the emails on the M5-dev list. Meng's stuff is
impressive:
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~jm6dg/fractal/m5patches.htm
I fear that Meng's MT patches shall keep the two threads benchmarks in
the same context/cache footprint, I think it runs the the second thread
on a fetch.
I might be able to use that, but I am looking to see if something akin
to Sampling (http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Sampling) might do
what I am looking for, maybe use the feature of draining the pipe then
try some shenanigans.
What I should really like is to run task 1 for sometime, context switch
to task 2 and look at the two footprints in memory and then swap task 1
back in look at the footprint.
Cheers,
Will
