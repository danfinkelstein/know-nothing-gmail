actually the entire command line output went like# ./twolf00.peak.ev6 testmodprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No such file or directorymodprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No such file or directorybash: ./twolf00.peak.ev6: cannot execute binary file(sorry for not including the last line in my last email, my bad)so i think the benchmark was not executed. and besides, no output file was produced. the name of the executable changed  since i switched to the precompiled binary i downloaded off the Internet(so the crosscompiler can't be the culprit). am i missing something? i mean, what i did basically was place the binary and the input files in the image(latest-linux.img, the one that came with the m5 distro), boot the simulator, and then run the executable.is that the correct procedure  for running  benchmarks in FS mode?thanks a lot for

The benchmark is almost certainly still running, just some syscall it did attempted to load a module, however that module isn't necessary. AliOn Oct 5, 2007, at 9:49 PM, w. tan wrote:i am trying to run cpu2000 benchmarks in full system mode, and already compiled the benchmarks using the crosscompiler. after copying the binaries to the image i then tried running the benchmarks within the simulated system. i got the error # ../TimberWolfSC stdcellmodprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No such file or directorymodprobe: FATAL: Could not load
