I'm not clear on what you're trying to achieve... you want each thread
to suspend when it reaches a certain instruction count?  What I'd do
then is create your PauseThreadEvent in the CPU constructor where you
have access to the thread context pointer(s) so you can pass it in to
your PauseThreadEvent constructor.  This should look a lot like the
spot in the BaseCPU constructor where the CountedExitEvents are
created, only you'll have to put it in the derived CPU class's
constructor since the thread contexts aren't created yet in the
BaseCPU constructor.

That's an easy one: assuming your file is in src/sim, just add
Source('pause_thread_event.cc') to src/sim/SConscript.
