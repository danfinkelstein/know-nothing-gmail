Just curious: which memory tester are you referring to, and how does it differ from the MemTest object that's already in src/memtest?Steve- Show quoted text -On Fri, Jun 5, 2009 at 6:19 PM, Rick Strong <rstrong@cs.ucsd.edu> wrote:
It all sounds very useful. Basically, I want a system where I can just
do simple queries and have interesting questions answered on the spot
without extra scripting. I also want to know more about swig, the
C/Python API, so count me in. The one issue is that I am still trying to
get the performance in the directory coherence multi-banked patch
up-to-par and am adding performance optimizations and working with
Jiayuan to add MESI coherence protocol. I also wanted to get the memory
tester into M5-dev, as I think it catches lots of memory bugs in actual
applications. So I might be a bit slow on this project until that is
done. In the meantime, I will try to get the current setup with the
database working on my machine and ping you about cleaning up the API.
Have a good weekend,
