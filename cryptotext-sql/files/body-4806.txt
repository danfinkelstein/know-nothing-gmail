Hi Uday,

My question is: When Linux decides to deschedule a thread and start executing another thread, exactly where in the M5 code all registers get saved?
Shouldn't the operating system (i.e. the simulated linux) take care of saving the registers (e.g. by copying them to the main memory)?
regards,
Jonas
