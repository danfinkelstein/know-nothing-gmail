Yea, if Elliott sends us a diff we'll be happy to commit it. In general we're happy to commit patches as long as they don't break other functionality. The request for a diff, as opposed to changes in the e-mail has a few benefits
a) It reduces the error involved in transposing the change (it can be automatically applied with patch)
b) It makes It easier on us, so we'll be more likely to incorporate your fix
c) It increases the likelihood that we'll understand what you're trying to do
d) If patches do become frequent it allows patches to be inserted into a patch queue automatically
When we open up the repository, mailing a change should be as easy as typing a single command line. I hope people will contribute regularly when that happens. Publishing your fixing for a bug or new functionality can save someone the time of repeating the work later and ultimately increase the overall success of M5.

Great, thanks for sharing! Some of my tests were also failing due to missing
stat64 (at the very end though, so I didn't bother too much with that yet).
Is this going to go into the main tree?
