Hi,
 I have done some changes on O3CPU model of M5 to get different performance-related metrics such as cache misses, register file accesses, etc. at runtme.  I need to run an in-order CPU (similar to Alpha EV4) and get these performance metrics again. 
 I was wondering if I can change the O3CPU model to model an in-order architecture. If this is possible, I will still be able to use my changed code to get performance metrics I need when running the in-order CPU. 
   Has anyone done something similar before?  Thanks   Shervin
