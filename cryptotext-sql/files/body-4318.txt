There are two possibilities.
a) You were running for a set number of ticks, so you wouldn't see any change in sim_ticks because the number of ticks was controlling the length of the simulation.
b) You were using the AtomicSimpleCPU instead of either the TimingSimpleCPU or the O3CPU, so the DRAM latency wasn't being accounted for.

Hi,
   I implement different page allocation algorithms(virtual to physical
address translation algorithm) based on current DRAM model in full
system(m5_2.0b). After running simulations(benchmark is ValStream), I
could see more than 20% difference in average DRAM access latency
within all these algorithms, but almost 0% difference in sim_ticks.
   Is that because the caculated dram latency is not used? Can anybody
explain that to me?
   Thanks.
