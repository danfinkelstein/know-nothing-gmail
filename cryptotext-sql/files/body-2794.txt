I just added the linux-patches repository to repo.m5sim.org. It is a
Mercurial Queues repository of patches that we apply on top of the
Linux Mercurial repository (http://www.kernel.org/hg/linux-2.6/). The
standalone patches on the website will not be updated in the future.
If you would like the latest patches please either use the patch queue
or download the tarball and apply the patches in the order listed in
the series file.
