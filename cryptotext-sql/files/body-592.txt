Hi,
This is the first time I try to install and build M5 on my computer.
I followed all the steps, and met the following error after I typed
this command:  % scons build/ALPHA_SE/tests/debug/quick .
g++ -o build/ALPHA_SE/sim/main.do -c -Wno-deprecated -pipe -fno-strict-
aliasing -Wall -Wno-sign-compare -Wundef -arch x86_64 -ggdb3 -Werror -

python2.6/pyconfig.h:1013:5: error: "__BIG_ENDIAN__" is not defined
scons: *** [build/ALPHA_SE/sim/main.do] Error 1
scons: building terminated because of errors.
My system is Mac OS X version 10.6. Anybody has some idea about how to
fix this error?
Any idea would be appreciated!
Thanks,
Jie
