If the two CPUs are running two different instances of the same
workload, then they ought to start fetching from the same (virtual)
PC.  If they don't, then there's some problem in the initialization
code.  It might have something to do with using EIO traces rather than
LiveProcess objects (which I'm guessing is what you're doing from the
names of your workloads).
