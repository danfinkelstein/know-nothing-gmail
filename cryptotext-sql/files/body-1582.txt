hi everyone,I am working on SPEC CPU 2006 in SE mode. While simulation is tested for single thread per core, it works well but when testing with more than one thread per core, I got the panic problem. The error display as:
warn: Increasing stack size by one page.panic: Tried to execute unmapped address 0. @ cycle 17190562000[invoke:build/ALPHA_SE/arch/alpha/faults.cc, line 186]Program aborted at cycle 17190562000
Could anyone please help me to guide towards the solution of this problem?Thanks in advance,D.R. Chapagain
