If the problem results from resuming from a checkpoint, I'd guess that
there's something still wrong with the serialization code.  Try to
figure out where that address came from (turn on ExecTrace and search
for the address, then break on that cycle and figure out where it
comes from), and my guess is that something got stored incorrectly in
the checkpoint.  It's also worthwhile to figure out what that address
actually translates to.  I.e. which device register it seems to
represent.
One very quick guess (and I don't know anything about this) is that
bmiAddr and bmiSize were not serialized.  It seems that maybe they
should be.
