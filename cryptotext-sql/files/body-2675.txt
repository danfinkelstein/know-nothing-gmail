Hello,
     I read the M5 repo 
documentation and the hgbook on using hg and mq. I am confused between which 
approach I should be using for making my own changes to m5-stable. One way is 
to make my changes and use the hg commit. I can pull changes to the source 
using hg fetch and it does a 3-way merge when required.
 
The other way is to use the 'q' commands - qinit, 
qnew, qrefresh, etc. Could someone elaborate whats the best way to go about 
it?
 
Thanks,
Sujay
