Hello there,
Are there any major impediments in building m5 in SPARC_SE or SPARC_FS
configurations on SunOS 9 on a SPARC machine? When I build M5 in
SPARC_SE config using GCC, the final executable (m5.debug) gives a bus
error. However, when I try to build it using SUN C++, I get build
errors, which according to some forums, are due to a potential bug in
the Sun compiler. I can attach the build logs/errors if you want to
take a look.
regards,
Soumyaroop.
