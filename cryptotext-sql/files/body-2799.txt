Sure, but I was wondering is there an easier way to 
connect between the dynamic python parameters and the c++ code?

    Hello,
         I am trying to get the 
    dynamic values of the system configuration and use it in a custom .cc file 
    in M5. For example, I would like to get the numcpus, or L2 size, etc. which 
    is either in the .py files or specified in the config files. How do I get 
    these values and use it in my files?
     
    Thanks,
    Sujay
