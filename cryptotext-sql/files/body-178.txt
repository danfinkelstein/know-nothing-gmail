There was a question just a couple of weeks ago on the mailing list on
just this same topic.  Please look in the archives to see that
discussion, as it may be helpful.  The short answer is that the best
(and perhaps only) way to understand exactly what the stats are
counting is to look at the source code.  If you still have specific
questions after looking at the mailing list archives and the source,
feel free to ask them here.
