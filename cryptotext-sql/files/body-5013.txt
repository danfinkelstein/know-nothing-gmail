Hi all,
 
I'm using M5_1.1 version. Under original condition, 
when I'm running netperf-maerts benchmark, and do the sampling with 
'Sampler(periods = [1e9, 200e6])', it always gives me about 67k packets 
transmitted during this period. However, after I modified the ethernet dev 
file a little bit, it only gave me about 2k packets transmitted, and there is 
almost no statistics in the output file. It seems like nothing is excuting 
during the 200e6 cycles. How to figure out this problem?
 
Thanks,
Yu
