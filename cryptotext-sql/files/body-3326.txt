Hmmmm, something is broken, I’ve been trying and nothing seems
to work.  I can’t dump a timing_cpu checkpoint, because reloading it causes M5
to crash on initialization, certain serialization elements are missing.  When I
dump an atomic cpu checkpoint of the same benchmark, I can load it, but the
kernel immediately panics and crashes.  Any ideas?  Was checkpointing broken
prior to 2.0b5?
 
Thanks,
Geoff

I’m pretty sure its loading the correct checkpoints.  What
is really odd is if I load the atomic CPU checkpoint with Atomic CPU, it still
crashed with a page handler error. I’ll keep fiddling, perhaps the
serialization routines are broken on my build. I’m using a version of M5 from
the repository that is older than 2.0b5, I should probably pull again to get
the new changes.

i had this happen to me when i
was dumping atomic && timing checkpoints into the same directory, and
specifying checkpoint 1 - but it would read the wrong one and give me that
exact error because it was reading the first checkpoint (an atomic checkpoint)
rather than the first timing checkpoint.  if you're doing the same, you'll
want to separate them.

I'm trying to dump out a checkpoint of multi-core system using Full System
to allow me to run a profile of the binaries I'm running in M5. I dump the
checkpoint using the m5 pseudo instruction from inside the application. 
The checkpoint though seems malformed.  If I dump it out running with
timing simple cpu, the checkpoint will not load, the simulator crashes with a
fatal error saying it cannot read _status for system.cpuXX.  I've tried
making checkpoints using the atomic CPU, and they seem load fine, but
immediately after starting to run once the checkpoint is loaded, the binary
crashes with a kernel page handling error, perhaps due to the fact it does not
save any ITB entries.  Is there something I am forgetting?
