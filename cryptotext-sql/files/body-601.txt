Thanks for the reply, Lisa.
So, if I understand correctly, the patch that you have enables
simulation of 'n' workloads on 'n' single-threaded cores after
restoring them from 'n' checkpoints, right?
By when do you plan to push the patch to the dev tree? And, I think I
could perform some testing on it. I have some testing infrastructure
set up.
