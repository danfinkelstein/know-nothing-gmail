The number of instructions for other cpus were zero. Below is my configuration for the CPU and benchmarks I assigned for each cpu. Could you please help me to figure about why instruction is not executed in other cpu. Also, I am using EioProcess. Configuration for the system is as follows:

You are declaring absolute paths for process1, process2, and process4 (i.e.
"/speccpu2000" and not just "speccpu2000"), thus only process3 is getting a
valid eio trace to start with. If you remove the leading slash, it should work
properly.
