Hi all,
 
I'm modeling the interconnection, when modeling the interconnection and 
simulate all the routers, I am following the bus that broadcast a packet to all 
the snoop ports if dest is broadcast.
 
However, I came to this during debugging in timing mode with my 
interconnection prototype:
m5.debug: build/ALPHA_SE/mem/cache/miss/mshr.hh:211: MSHR::Target* 
MSHR::getTarget(): Assertion `hasTargets()' failed.
 
triggered in Cache::handleResponse at the statement:
cache_impl.hh:707:  MSHR::Target *initial_tgt = 
mshr->getTarget();
 
doing a trace reveals that the broadcast request got two requests 
(ReadExResp) from two nodes. (an L1 cache's memSidePort receives response first 
from a peer L1's memSidePort, and then from the L2's memSidePort).
 
Is there any clue on top of your head about how this happens? My guess 
is the peer's L1 snoops the packet and found a match, so both the peer L1 and L2 
both responsed the request, the second request got missed in the mshr 
because the target has already been fulfilled. What do you think?
 
Thanks!
 
Jiayuan
