Hi Ali,
Thank you so much for the helpful elaboration!
Some follow up questions:
Where can I find 00.hello-mp?
For simulating the multithreaded program, we actually want to test different
scheduling policies and load balance the workloads among cores. Using
Pthreads under FS mode might be a good option, is there a scheduler in FS
mode where I can implement different scheduling policies? If there isn't a
scheduler, what do I have to do to add one myself?
Thanks again!

It is possible. If you look at our 00.hello-mp regression test you
can get an idea of how a CMP would be setup. However,
by default there isn't any sharing. Each core is executing a
different process.

This will be very difficult to implement in M5. You'll have to pretty
much re-implement the pthreads library as well as a process/context
switcher and a scheduler. Why not just run a full-system simulation
and use pthreads?
* New instructions can be implemented as pseudo ops: src/sim/
pseudo_inst.* and src/arch/alpha/isa/decoder.isa
* To add new syscalls have a look at src/arch/alpha/(linux|tru64)/*
and kern/(tru64|linux)/*
* Initial stacks and the like are created in src/sim/process.cc and
src/arch/alpha/process.cc
* We haven't implemented something like a scheduler, so there isn't a
place for you to look at source code, but to implement it well you'll
probably want some kind of interrupt to happen in the cpu's tick()
loop and you can go off and save one threads state and restore a
different ones. We do something like that for window traps on SPARC.

That would work fine as well, but with 2.0b3 you can only have one
level of coherence. By the time 2.0f is out that will be solved.

It completely depends on your memory system configuration, how many
cpus you have and what kind of cpus you have as well as what hardware
you're running it on. 64bit x86 machine tend to be significantly
faster than 32bit ones.

These warnings are normal. They are just informative, the benchmark
is running.
