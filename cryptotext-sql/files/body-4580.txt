Hi All,
 I want to simulate a system in which I have only L1 cache latency,i.e.,
if I have a miss in the L1 cache and the data is fetched from L2 cache or
from memory still I want to observe just the L1 cache latency. Can I make
the latency of L2 cache/memory to be 0 to achieve this? Or is there any
parameter in M5 configuration, like max load latency or something, which I
can set so as to fulfill my objective.
Thanks,
Prabhat
