Not withot a fair number of patches.  See
   http://www.csl.cornell.edu/~vince/projects/m5
to see m5 current x86 status, at least with regard to the spec2k binaries.
With about 15 different patches applied (I'm slowly getting them merged)
maybe about 1/2 of the spec2k benchmarks will run on the simple atomic
processor in syscall emulation mode.
