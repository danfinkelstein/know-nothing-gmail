Certainly nothing that is going to be quick (as counted in days).
You're basically going to have to implement the network link/switch
components and the coherence protocol that you wish to run on top of
it.  We can certainly help you along the way with pointing you at the
interfaces that you need to use, but you're basically going to have to
write a coherence protocol yourself (or fake it).
