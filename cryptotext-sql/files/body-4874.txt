Hi,
I would like to instantiate multiple cores and still have control over the
internals of the processors and the communication between them. Basically what
I want to do is to define a higher level module that has r/w access to
processor modules, so that we can accurately model the system we are
investigating.
For example, I would like to modify the fetch stage so that each processor is
running successive instructions of the same program. So say proc0 is running
instructions 0,2,4,6... and proc1 is running instructions 1,3,5,7... Do you
have any advice on how to implement this?
Thanks,
Christopher
