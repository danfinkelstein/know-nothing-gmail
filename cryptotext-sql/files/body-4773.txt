Can you check to make sure that you actually have /usr/local/lib/libpython2.4.so?
You might also need to run ldconfig or ldconfig /usr/local/lib to make sure that ld can find it.
  Nate- Show quoted text -
 I am trying to install m5 2.0 beta 2 version.
 I have all the necessary prerequisetes (python 2.4, swig 1.3.31, scons 0.96.93).
 My python is installed in /usr/local/ area.
 So, i am trying to build the target by:
 /usr/local/bin/python2.4 /usr/bin/scons build/ALPHA_FS/m5.debug.
 But it is giving this error:
 scons: Reading SConscript files ...
Checking for C header file Python.h... (cached) yes
/usr/local/lib python2.4
Adding /usr/local/lib to LIBPATH for python2.4
Checking for C library python2.4... no
Error: can't find Python library python2.4
But of course python2.4 is present under /usr/local/lib/.
 Please help.
 -Regards,
 Uday
