Dear Maximilien,
It seems to me that you are using the term "execution-trace" to imply
the trace of the instructions as they finish executing (EX stage). Is
that correct? Which test program are you using to simulate on the CPU?
It is possible that there is hardcoded logic within the code for a
stage width of 1 although I do not recall any at this time. Korey
should be able to comment on it better. I assume that you're working
with the ALPHA_SE configuration.
You will find some documentation about InOrder on this page:
