Hi Rick,
Regarding the O3 CPU tracing misspeculated instructions, it only
prints out valid, committed instructions.  The key function for
determining what instructions get printed out is when dump() gets
called on the traceData.  You'll notice that it only gets called in
commit_impl.hh on instructions that have committed.  Right now there's
actually no option for printing out misspeculated instructions, though
in the future it can be added in.
Regarding the unexpected output that you're getting, the problem is
probably that the retireHead() function gets called on both squashed
and committed instructions.  It may be a bit of a misnomer in that
case, as it really removes the head instruction (it depends on your
definition of retire).  It is definitely a misnomer that the
instruction in there is set as committed, regardless of it being
squashed or committed.
I would suggest you look for the places where dump() gets called and
put your call to setCommitted there instead.  If you still have issues
with garbage output let me know.
Kevin
