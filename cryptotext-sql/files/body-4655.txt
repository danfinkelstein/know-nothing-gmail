I used EioProcess to read EIO traces under M51.1, it was great.Currently I am migrating my code to M52.0b2(plus 
M5 2.0b2 encumbered files) , however I met error below:========================================================(gdb) runStarting program: /home/linj/nuca_work/prog/m5.debug test.py[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]

Memory Usage: 193536 KBytesProgram exited with code 01.============================================================When eio file is large( > 400MB) I met the problem, If the eio file is small(<100MB), it is OK.
The machine I use has 8GB memory and since I can run m51.1 with eio traces, I think it is not a machine problem.Can any of you help me out? I am not sure if I config something wrong.Thanks,Jiang
