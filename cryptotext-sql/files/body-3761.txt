Hi,
 
I am currently working with M5 to test out the possible
benefits of a cache coherence protocol that adds a conflicted state on top of the
standard MESI protocol.  To test the correctness of my change I ran the
regression tests and was unable to pass the memtest regression test.  Also
I was unable to get any of the splash benchmarks to complete.  After debugging
my code I eventually tried to run it on pristine M5 code using the MESI
protocol and was still unable to pass the memtest regression test or finish any
of the splash benchmarks (I am running in SE mode) as well.  
 
I think I have tracked down the issue to a problem with the
L2 cache failing to snarf bus responses when the cpus broadcast the data across
the bus.  I cannot completely confirm this but it currently explains all
of the behavior I see.  I was wondering if this issue has ever been
identified before and if you had any other suggestions.  Also I was
wondering where the code for snarfs by the L2 cache is as I was unable to track
it down in the M5 code or if there are other places I should look.
 
Any help you could provide would be greatly appreciated and
please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
 
Thanks
Paul Cooper
