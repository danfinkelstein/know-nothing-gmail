If you're using syscall emulation (SE) mode, you can use as many cores
as you want.  However, since M5 itself is currently single threaded,
your simulations will run slower as you add more cores.  Also, our
only interconnect right now is a bus, so that will become a bottleneck
if you don't replace it with something more scalable (or just crank it
up to an unrealistic frequency to keep it from being a bottleneck).
In full system (FS) mode, you're practically limited to 64 cores
because of OS/BIOS limitations (and you have to apply some patches
just to get to that level).

In SE mode, you can run different programs on different cores easily.
Running multithreaded programs is possible but trickier, and has only
been done for Alpha Tru64 SPLASH benchmarks; see
http://m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Splash_benchmarks.  You could extend
this technique to run other multithreaded binaries if you wanted
though.
In FS mode, you can run any set of applications that would run on a
real Linux system.

We don't support PowerPC at all.  We have x86 mode in development, but
it's not released yet.  FS mode supports Alpha and SPARC (though I
think the SPARC support is somewhat limited).

M5 doesn't do everything out of the box, but I don't know of another
simulator that does... each has its own set of limitations, generally.
