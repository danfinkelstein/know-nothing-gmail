You need to have the header files for python available. If you look in the build/.scons_config directory you can see the test programs that SCons is trying to compile to verify your installation. Trying to compile one of those by hand will probably give you a more meaningful error message. It's almost certainly that Python.h isn't installed or in place your compiler will find it.Ali- Show quoted text -On Jul 13, 2007, at 1:25 AM, Dean Michael Ancajas wrote:- Show quoted text -[dean@moonfang m5-2.0b3]$ scons build/ALPHA_SE/tests/debug/quickscons: Reading SConscript files ...Checking for C header file Python.h... yesAdding /usr/local/lib to LIBPATH for python2.5Checking for C library python2.5... noError: can't find Python library python2.5[dean@moonfang m5-2.0b3]$I already have libpython2.5.so.1 and libpython2.5.so that is symbolically linked with the former(got the files from an RPM and extracted it with cpio). they are both in /usr/local/lib and /usr/lib/. i already ran the ldconfig command to both directories. my python 2.5 installation is on /usr/bin. I installed it using source tarball with the default way of installing it(no addition configs) "./configure","make" and "make install" only.btw my setup is scientific linux 3(clone of redhat enterprise 3). my gcc version is "gcc version 3.2.3 20030502 (Red Hat Linux 3.2.3-59)" and I already have the latest versions of SWIG and SCONS.I would really appreciate if anybody out there can help me. I have already looked into the mailing list archives and I wasn't able to find what I needed.  Thanks. -- Dean Michael B.
