Hi everyone,
I'm trying to implement SMARTS-like functionality in the Alpha SE
version of m5. So far I have managed to get the simulator to switch
between the AtomicSimpleCPU and DerivO3CPU and back again repeatedly.
I've also implemented functionality to do the switching after a certain
number of instructions (instead of cycles).
However, when I switch cpus, I set the new CPU to use the warmed caches
from the old cpu. The same doesn't happen for the itb and dtb. In fact,
from looking at the code I think that 2 different instances of these get
created, one for each cpu.
So, how easy would it be to implement this and where would I start?
Could I do this in cpu/BaseCPU.py, cpu/base.cc, cpu/base.hh only or do I
need to consider other places too?
Thanks for your help
Tim
