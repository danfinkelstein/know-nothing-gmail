hi,I have encountered a problem while simulating a configuration(.py) file.The error is:fatal: Out of memory, please increase size of physical memory. @ cycle 0[new_page:build/ALPHA_SE/sim/system.cc, line 230]
Memory Usage: 2295488 KBytesThen in order to remove this error, i changed the allocated physical memory size, i.e., initially was "2056 MB" then changed to "16GB" step by step but got still the same problem.
When i increase the physical memory to 32 GB for checking, at this time the error is as:mmap: Cannot allocate memoryfatal: Could not mmap! @ cycle 0[PhysicalMemory:build/ALPHA_SE/mem/physical.cc, line 66]
Memory Usage: 131804 KBytesCould you please help me, i could not fix this problem..... Thank you,devraj
