It's true that cygwin simply does not have fenv.h.  Note that not
having fenv.h is merely a warning and not a fatal condition.  M5
should still build just fine, you just might end up with very minor
differences in FP results because it can't precisely mimic all the FP
rounding modes etc. that a program might use (since M5 just uses the
host's FPU to implement FP instructions).
So SE mode should work under cygwin; let us know if it doesn't.  Last
time I checked, FS mode doesn't work because some of the I/O stuff
relies on signals which aren't properly supported under cygwin either.
 Overall due to fundamental cygwin limitations (e.g., gdb support is
also lousy, so it's hard to debug) I strongly recommend just running a
pared-down Linux in a VM if you need to develop on a Windows
machine... there are several free options out there (I use VMware
Server).
