Have you modified the simulator, particularly the memory system, in
any way? This error occurs when an object in the memory system
receives a packet it was not expecting. If you have modified the
simulator, the problem probably has to do with the modifications
you've made, if you haven't modified it then you should enable some
trace flags like Bus, Cache, etc to see what happens leading up to
this error. With that data you should be able to better understand
what is going wrong and begin to realize how to fix it.
