 Â  Can you tell me the way to run two different programs in two
different cores?
Set the workload parameter of each cpu to the workload you want to run, e.g.:
cpu[0].workload = Benchmarks.AnagramLongCP()
cpu[1].workload = Benchmarks.GCCLongCP()
Is it possible to use the following assignment in M5_1.1 SE mode?
cpu[0].workload = Benchmarks.stest1()
cpu[2].workload = Benchmarks.stest2()
I try it, and it gives me the error message, " AttributeError: Can't
resolve proxy 'workload' from 'cpu1' ". I want to know if there has
any way to resolve this kind of assignment.
The reason is that we want to execute multi-threads programs on M5 SE
mode. The stest1() is a two threads program. We modify M5_1.1, so it
can execute two threads on CPU0 and CPU1. We want to execute the
single thread program stest2() on CPU3 at the same time.
thanks,
