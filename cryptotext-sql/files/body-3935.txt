Ok. Though I dont know what to look for, since there's nothing that I have changed since beta3. Which output files should I examine?
The benchmarks ends because m5 reports "target called exit()".

Thanks, this is very interesting.  Have you looked at the output from
the benchmarks that are producing weird results?  I'd say from those
stats (and your comment that those benchmarks are finishing "extremely
fast") that the real problem is that the benchmark is terminating
early, before it even gets to forking off threads on the other CPUs,
due to some error.  Presumably the output is indicating what the
problem is if you look in the right place.
So there's still some problem with b4 if you weren't encountering that
error in b3, but it's not that the cache statistics are broken.
Steve
