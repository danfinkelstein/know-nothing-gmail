I believe EV5 did not have such instructions, so if you use a crosscompiler targeted to EV5 (which you can specify when you build with http://freshmeat.net/projects/crosstool-ng/).
 
Alternatively, I don't know if there is a compiler switch for turning off the generation of MVI instructions (of which maxuw4 is a member), so you could look into that if you don't want to build a new crosscompiler.

One way is to implement the instructions, other way is probably to find some sort of compiling flag to not produce this instructions. Anyways any advice, experience or thoughts on this problem is appreciated.
