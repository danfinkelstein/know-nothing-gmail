Hi,
When using the ARM_SE simulator, the following program prints out 19:
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  int a = 50;
  a = a / 7;
  printf("The Result is %d \n", a);
  return 0;
}
However, I would expect it to be 7.
Any ideas why this is happening?
If I modify the fourth line as follows:
  a = (float)a / 7;
  a = a / (float)7;
  a = (float)a / (float)7;
Then it works.
Thanks
David
