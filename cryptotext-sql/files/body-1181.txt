I'd say this looks like a swig problem... swig can be particular about
versions, so having too new a version of other tools (particularly
python, perhaps also gcc) relative to your swig version can be as bad
as having too old a version.  If you continue to have trouble I'd take
a look at the swig web page to see if they have any compatibility info
there.
