Thank you for your reply, Nate. I think it would be better to just turn off the port 7000 that the debugger may listen on. I mean make the remote debugger not listen on this port, then it would be quiet. Is that right? Because sometimes I still need to run the GDB to do some debug.

Well, the remote debugger just sits there listening on port 7000 whichanyone could probe.  You can turn it off by calling
m5.debug.setRemoteGDBPort(0) at the top of your script.  You couldalso call m5.disableAllListeners() to disable all ports including theterminal ports.  (Generally a good idea if you're not debugging.)Nate
