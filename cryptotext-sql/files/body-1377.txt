OK, I figured it out... the apparent sensitivity to tracing being
enabled wasn't an issue of tracing being on or not, but whether output
was redirected to a file (which changes whether libc does block- or
line-buffering, which then changes the code path slightly).  It ended
up being a legitimate bug in the new coherence protocol.  I've added a
patch below that fixes the problem, though I haven't run the full
regressions yet.  See the comment in the patch for an explanation.
BTW, Joe, would you be willing to contribute your DRAM code back to
M5?  We'd love to have a more detailed DRAM timing model that we can
ship.  (Same offer goes out to anyone else with a DRAM timing model,
or any other cool extensions!)
