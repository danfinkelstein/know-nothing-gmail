Hi Jonas,
The fix has been committed to our main tree. We do look at the bugs on the bug tracker, however we're more likely respond to an e-mail. When we open up the repository we'll add notifications to the developer mailing list when tasks are added/modified/changed/etc.
Thanks,

Hi,
I just realized that this bug had already been reported in the bug tracker
(#287). It seems like the bug tracker is not really used right now though...
Maybe it would help integrating the tracker with the mailing list?
