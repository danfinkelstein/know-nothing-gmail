Hi Gabe, thanks for your reply.  Do you mean that the image should contain a kernel like vmlinux or something like that ? If it doesn't contain one, then I should compile one myself, is that right ?I downloaded the stage3 from the net, how can I possibly know what kernel they use?  
Thanks for you guiding on how to replace the init script, I hope that works. Thank you !

The kernel you're using is probably not in the image. It's whatever
you're passing to m5 with the --kernel option when you start it up. If
you want to replace the init process in the image, I think it's called
/sbin/init. Assuming you've got things set up properly I think you can
use a command line option to select what init script to use, but I'm not
entirely sure what's required for that to work.

Hi, all, I am confused of how to add new class to M5. When I added a new
class called RaceCache in the src/mem/cache, and modified the SConscript and
some other files, I got an compile error as followed:
*build/ALPHA_FS/libm5_opt.a(params_wrap.o): In function
`_wrap_RaceCacheParams_create':
/m5-stable-733318abb7b1/build/ALPHA_FS/params/params_wrap.cc:31843:
undefined reference to `RaceCacheParams::create()'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
scons: *** [build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt] Error 1
*
I am always confused with anything related to params, I think that may be a
simple error because of my unfamiliarity of M5, can somebody give me some
hints on how to deal with this ? Thanks !

Did this class derive from BaseCache?
If so, then you are probably creating a new "SimObject" which gets
instantiated via the swig-python(?)/Params interface.
Look in src/mem/cache/builder.cc.
In there, you'll see a BaseCache "create()" function that is used to create
a cache object with the typical M5 params.
Somewhere, you are going to need a "create() function for you SimObject if
you intend to be able to instantiate it through a config file.
