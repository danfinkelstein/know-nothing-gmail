Ah yes, how could I forget...
  I have also placed a script that generates these scripts on my site.  Note that it requires the command line parameters file also located there:
    http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~hestness/links/writescripts.pl
    http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~hestness/links/inputsets.txt
  You will probably have to do some hacking on the script for your particular arrangement, but hopefully the out-of-box results will be close (no guarantees are written or implied concerning the correctness of these scripts :P).  More information about PARSEC input sets and PARSEC command lines can be found in the benchmark suite itself.
  Good luck. Enjoy,
  Joel

Hi Joel,I would love to try the parsec benchmarks on a full system model. Do youhave any sehll scripts that run the benchmarks.
