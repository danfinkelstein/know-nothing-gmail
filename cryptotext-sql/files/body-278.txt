Thanks for the reply.I don't think that is the problem because the first pthread function calledin the hello.cpp was correctly found.I was looking inside the pthreads library generated and I noticed that this
pthread_join function wasn't listed there. I really can't imagine a reason.To create the library I executed the following two lines:sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -c pthread.c -o m5pthread.osparc64-unknown-linux-gnu-ar csr libm5pthread.a m5pthread.o

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"I was able to successfuly compile my test program without callingpthread_join().But, when I run the executable on the platform with 2 SPARCs, the following
happened:command line: ./build/SPARC_SE/m5.fast configs/splash2/teste.py -n 2 -bHelloworldGlobal frequency set at 1000000000000 ticks per second0: system.remote_gdb.listener: listening for remote gdb on port 7000

Program aborted at cycle 76104000AbortedI suppose it happens when I try to create a second thread.The teste.py script is the splash2/run.py modified to use my executable fileinstead.Has someone successfully compiled and ran a multithreaded Sparc software?
