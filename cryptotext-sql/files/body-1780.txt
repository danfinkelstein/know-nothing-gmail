Here is beta 2.0 of the patches that provide 
on-chip network(2D mesh), directory-based coherence (MSI and MESI), and a 
threading API in SE mode. The patches are still based on changeset 
5505:90d6811d5ea6, and in the future I'll integrate it into a more recent 
release. The major updates are in DirectoryCache.patch.

to Rick:
 
For MSI directory coherence only, you don't have to care about other 
patches on top of it unless you need them, which include MESI, MultiPortedCache, 
CacheStats, and SimpleMultiThreads.
 
Note that in this version, a read/write request that will replace an 
existing block will combine two packets (an Evict piggybacked by a read/write). 
This was originally done in two phases which lead to the bug about incorrect 
store conditionals.
