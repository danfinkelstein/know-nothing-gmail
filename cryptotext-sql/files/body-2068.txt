Dear All,
I am trying to plug a new component to the cpu to get the address issued by the
cpu to the cache. My intention is to change that address and send it to the
cache. so that the cache doesnot know that it has been modified and cache serves
the cpu with the address it receives. I was wondering where to do this. I mean
do I need to write this new component in c++ and use it as a configuration
component in python file or can I just use the python configuration file to get
the address and write the modified address back. The concern I am having is this
has to happen with every data access issued by the core to the DCache. (I am not
sure whether I am asking the question in a correct manner, cos still I am trying
to understand the big picture of m5, still bit confusing how things are
happening with c++ and python, for example if I write a new c++ component what
things do i need to do to make that component visible to the python
configuration file )
any help/advice on this regard would be greatly appreciate.
regards,
Isuru
