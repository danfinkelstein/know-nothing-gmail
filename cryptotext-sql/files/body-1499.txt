Yes, that extra bridge is the cause. What is happening is that the bridge is
being probed by l3bus which then probes l3bus2 for address ranges, l3bus2
probes the L3 cache for ranges as will l3bus a some point, both probes to
the bridge and the L3 cache will return the same address range at some point
causing the error.  The way address range propagation is handled currently
disallows more than 1 path to a device that responds to memory address
ranges, which is what that extra bridge is causing (2 possible paths to get
to the L3 cache and underlying physmem). You will either have to just limit
your experimentation to not doing this, or muck with the address range
propagation code in bus.cc to allow multiple paths.

Subject: Re: [m5-users] Range Error
I have attached a diagram(pdf file) of configuration and fs2.py. Please note
that the problem occurs because of l3Bridge (commented in fs2.py).
Ofcourse, I have a solution to maintain coherence at the back end.
