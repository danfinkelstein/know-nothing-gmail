I use the following two command lines:
(1) boot linux and create checkpoint
m5.debug -d result fs.py --caches --l2cache -b createcheckpoint      
## here "createcheckpoint" is a script to create checkpoint after boot
(2) restore from the checkpoint, warmup and then detailed simulation
m5.debug fs.py -t --caches --l2cache --checkpoint-dir result -r 1 -s -W 100000000 -I 1000000000 -b gzipOn Thu, Aug 7, 2008 at 11:30 PM, Sujay Phadke <sphadke@eecs.umich.edu> wrote:

Subject: [m5-users] switch cpu command- Show quoted text -
Hi all:
I expect the following steps in full system simulation:
(1) boot linux with atomic cpu and create a checkpoint after linux is
booted.
(2) restore from this checkpoint into timing cpu and warm up cache num1
instructions
(3) switch to a detailed cpu and run num2 instructions
(4) record the result of the num2 instrutions
let simulator: m5.debug
config file: fs.py
benchmark: gzip
Can anyone tell me how to write a command to accomplish the above steps?
Thank you very much.
