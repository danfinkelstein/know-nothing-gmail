Hi all,      I am Viswanath Krishanmurthy from Iowa State univ.  Can anyone please tell me as to how to run SPEC2000 benchmarks ( alpha  binaries) on the M5 simulator?..I already have the alpha binaries with  me. But I am not familiar as to how to run these benchmarks on the M5  simulator.        Thanks,        Regards        Viswanath Krishnamurthy
