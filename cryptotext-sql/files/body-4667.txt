I don't know offhand, but 50M instructions is not very long, and it's quite possible that the sequential thread is still initializing at that point.  I don't think the default sizes take all that long, so just try running without max_insts_any_thread and see what happens.

Hi,
I am trying to run SPLASH2 benchmarks using the ALPHA_SE mode for M5 v1.1
I don't see statistics for all the threads even if  I run with -ENP=4 and run it for max_insts_any_thread = 50000000. this is specially for CHolesky and FFT. I did get some statistics for radix/LU/Ocean
Do I need to run these benchmarks for longer?
Thanks,
Meeta
