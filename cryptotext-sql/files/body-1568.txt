Hi everybody,I have notices that there has been some modification to the ARM architecture on m5 repository.I downloaded a few weeks ago the m5 with Mercurial and the ARM_SE does not compile. (I had been working with ALPHA but, research wise I need ARM)
I downloaded again from the repository and it still does not compile; this time with different errors.Should it compile or is it not stable? Is there a stable version of ARM on m5 at the moment?Thanks,
