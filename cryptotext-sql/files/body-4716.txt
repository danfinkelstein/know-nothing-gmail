Hello,
I think I've encountered a problem with either the splash2 benchmarks
that you distributes, or the simulator, either way the "nxm_wakeup_idle"
syscall is unimplemented.
However, I've been unable to find any documentation about what this
syscall actually does, so that I could implement it. Any ideas?
