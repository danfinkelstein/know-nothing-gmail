Hello All,
I am working with the DRAM model for my simulations in SE mode. I use
the default configuration in PhysicalMemory.py for the RAS, CAS, ACT
etc times. It seems when the DRAMMemory object is initialized the
cas_lat, act_lat etc timing parameters are set in ps or the number of
simulation ticks. These variables are then used by the
calculateLatency function to estimate the latency of the memory access
in terms of simulation ticks. However, before returning this latency
value, the calculateLatency function multiplies it with cpu_ratio
(defined as ratio of CPU and memory bus frequency; set to 5 by
default). This looks confusing and unintuitive, since all the prior
calculations in the function are done in terms of simulation ticks
only, so how does cpu_ratio come into the picture?
Can anyone please provide insights here into what could be the
possible reason for doing so?
Thanks in advance,
-Gaurav
