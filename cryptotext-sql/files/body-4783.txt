Hi,
let me continue my monologue: :-)
With the latest 2.0b2 that was just published, my cache issues are
fixed, cache write backs seem to work fine. Thanks a lot!
Here are some other things that I came across:
1. When enabling the caches, m5 takes quite a lot of time to start the
simulation. I have not done any profiling yet, though.
2. Setting cache block sizes to 32 or smaller does not work using the
detailed CPU model:
command line: ./build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug ./configs/jonas/se4.py -d --caches
Mem mode:timing
warn: Entering event queue @ 0. Â Starting simulation...
m5.debug: build/ALPHA_SE/mem/cache/tags/cache_tags_impl.hh:314: typename
CacheTags<Tags, Compression>::BlkType* CacheTags<Tags,
Compression>::handleFill(typename Tags::BlkType*, MSHR*, unsigned int,
PacketList&, Packet*) [with Tags = LRU, Compression = NullCompression]:
Assertion `target->getOffset(blkSize) + target->getSize() <= blkSize'
failed.
Program aborted at cycle 8
Aborted
3. With the new Beta2, m5 seems to use Root.clock as the reference tick
for all statistics. I stumbled over it because my CPI was suddenly
really huge (>500). This really shocked me until I realized that
Root.clock defaults to 1THz, so a CPI of 500 makes perfect sense for a
2GHz machine (once you know about it :-) ). Thus, the CPI in the stats
is no longer measured in processor cycles but in "root-cycles". Is this
a bug or a feature?
Regards,
Jonas.
