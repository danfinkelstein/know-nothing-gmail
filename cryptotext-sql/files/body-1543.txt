Does a functional write from the debugger or something require a response?
Actually devices sinking functional writes should not convert the packet to a response as the packet needs to be propagated to any other device that might have a copy of the data (e.g., a cache).  It shouldn't hurt to generate a response on a functional read though.  Overall I don't see anything wrong with Cliff's patch, but I'd have to understand the bug it's addressing a little better to know whether it's really the right fix for that bug or not.
