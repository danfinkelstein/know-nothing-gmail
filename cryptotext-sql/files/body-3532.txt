Wow, that's quite an endorsement.

The funny thing (or not funny from your perspective) is that the old
feature is exactly for what you want.  m5_1.1 does have the binning
feature, and stats haven't changed much so it could probably be
re-added.
I actually liked the idea of the feature.  It could be re-added.  Any
old time developers have any opinions?
