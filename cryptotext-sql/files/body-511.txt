Hi All,
I am completley new to the field of simulation. Please provide me with
few links to tutorials and getting started links for simulation. (i
have gone through the slides and handouts on the wiki, however I still
feel that there is some other resource needed for me to learn the
basics)
It would be quite helpful if someone can highlight the pre-requisites.
Appreciate your efforts .
