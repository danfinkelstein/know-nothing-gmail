Hello,
The real problem as mentioned before by Rick Strong, is that during
simulation too many HW_MFPR and HW_MTPR instructions are being
generated. Any ideas on why so many are produced?  Its responsible for
50% of front engine stall!
For Blackscholes, they are not many system calls being made, its a
really simple program. Maybe the TLB is to small? Might be a linux
issue?
Any other ideas?
Thanks
