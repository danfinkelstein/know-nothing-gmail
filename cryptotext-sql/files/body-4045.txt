I used the exitcallback to register a function which is called at the end of simumations. I use floating point quantities in the simulations and wanted to print them out in my own format in a file. This function opens a file, dumps the required values into it at the end of simulation.
This is working perfectly in SE mode. But in the FS mode, there is no file being generated. The simulation ends (say when i do a ctrl-C) and dumps out the standard stats,but somehow does not call this exit function.

My other doubt is - Can I make this work in FS mode? Currently when I run a simulation in FS mode, its not writing to the file.
Stats really aren't any different between FS and SE. Â Can you explain your problem better?
