It was my mistake in my cpu model which is derived
from timing cpu. So, the statement i made in my
earlier mail is not completely correct.
If restored from a checkpoint (which was taken with an
atomic cpu), multiple timing cpus with caches is
working and running programs.
However, there is still a problem in the sense that
multiple timing simple cpus doesnt boot from scratch
(without any checkpoint) if caches are present. This
is true even after applying the patch.
