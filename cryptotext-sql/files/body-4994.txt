Hi,     I am new to using m5. I have installed m5_1.1 and have been successful in running in Splash2 benchmarks by downloading them.      I have also downloaded crosstool and have also compiled my cross-compiler. I have written a small program in C and have generated my Alpha binary using the cross compiler. It would be of great help if someone can tell me the steps I have follow to run this program on the m5 simulator.       regards-  Rajdeep
