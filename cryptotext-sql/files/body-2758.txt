Hi all,
I have some questions about quiesce:
1) If using just quiesce (without cycles or ns ... etc), m5sim.org
states that an interrupt is the means of waking up the core. Can any
interrupt be used or must there be a specific one? Also, for an
interrupt to schedule the tick() call after the quiesce call, which
lines of code are actually called after the interrupt is received to
reschedule the tick event?
2) When src/cpu/o3/cpu:activateContext calls fetch.wakeFromQuiesce(),
why is code line "fetchStatus[0] = Running" hard coded to zero instead
of using a thread id which is available in activateContext()? I assume
this means that we are only able to wake up thread 0?
3) What is the ozone cpu code all about? I found this section confusing
as it also has its own implementations of activateContext() and
wakeFromQuiesce()
Thanks in advance,
-Rick
