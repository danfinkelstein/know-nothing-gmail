Yes.- Show quoted text -
Thank you very much. So if I set up three systems,
M5 will automatically set their mac addresses to be
00:90:00:00:00:01, 00:90:00:00:00:02 and 00:90:00:00:00:03,
respectively. Right?

They're in the python code in src/python/m5/params.py, but as Ali said,
your switch model should not use that information and should autodiscover
the information.
What I asked is how M5 sets the mac addresses and what are
the unique values(ARP table). I didn't find it in the M5
source codes.

M5 sets the mac addresses automatically to be unique values. The
machines get each others MAC addresses through ARP discovery as they
would in any real system. Like I said, if you implement the IEEE
802.1D bridging spec, it will all just work.

The point is who sets those MAC address. The M5 simulator or
users? I know the IP addresses are set by users in .rcS files.
In the original M5, does each packet contain the destination
mac address? Could you tell me where a packet is created
in M5 source files? Thanks a lot.

The correct way is the MAC address, and it's always the mac address.
The IEEE 802.1D specification has a section on ethernet switches that
describes the process.

Actually, the EtherLink model can be completely replaced
by the EtherSwitch model. The topology is looked as follows:
                 -------------------------
System1--EtherInt1-|-Interface1--Interface2-|-EtherInt2--System2
                 |    \          /        |
                 |     \        /         |
                 |     Interface3         |
                 |         |              |
                 ----------|----------------
                       EtherInt3
                           |
                        System3
The above box is the switch model. The peer of EtherInt(i) is
set to be Interface(i) and Interfaces in the box are
interconnected with Links instead of EtherLinks.
In your switch model, even though there are N EtherInts in
the box and they are connected via Etherlinks from/to
outside, some kind of route procedure is still needed.
When the packet arrive at the EtherInt in the switch model,
how can you determine which port is appropriate? I think
the only way is to find the destination information from
the packet,no matter mac address or ip address.
So the question is how to get the destination information
from packet.

Hello,
I have created an EtherSwitch model to replace the EtherLink.
However, I got two problems:
1) In original EtherLink model, each Interface has only one
txlink, so when Interface::recvPacket(packet) is called by
its peer, txlink->transmit(packet) is returned. But in
the EtherSwitch model, each Interface has N-1 txlinks(N is
# of systems), so function recvPacket(packet) must
determine
which txlink is needed to transmit the packet.
The idea is that each two endpoints should have an EtherInt. So
each
system will have an EtherInt and then the switch should have a
separate EtherInt for each "port" that exists on the switch. The
probably should be connected with an EtherLink.
I tried to
find the destination information in the packet. I looked
through base/inet.hh and found the function dst() can
return
the destination address, so I wrote the following codes:
            IpPtr p = IpPtr(packet);
            uint32_t ip_address = p->dst();
But the simulator exited with error when it ran the
above codes. Can anyone know how to get the destination
information from the packet?
You should read the IEEE 802.1D ethernet standard. Not all packets
transfered across ethernet are IP packets. You need to route
based on
MAC addresses, not on IP addresses. The switch model needs to
keep a
list of MAC addresses behind each port and then when it receives a
packet it needs to find the appropriate port and send the packet to
it. To be complete the model also needs to detect when no port
exists
and respond appropriately.
2) similar to the above problem. In original EtherLink model,
when Interface::isBusy() is called, it just returns
txlink->busy() since it has only one txlink. But in the
EtherSwitch model,  isBusy doesn't know which txlink
is needed to transmit the packet and the worse is no packet
can be used to determine the destination. One feasible
solution is make sure all txlinks are free before a packet
is transmitted although only one txlink is used. My
question is how to modify the original code in order to
replace isBusy() by isBusy(packet).
I think this will be more clear when you read the above
specification,
but the architecture should look something like this:
