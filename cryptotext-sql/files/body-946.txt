Hello all,
I made an observation that has me confused and I need some
clarification. On inspecting the o3-timing stats for 00.hello, I found
the following:
sim_insts = 6386
system.cpu.commit.commitCommittedInsts = 6403
system.cpu.committedInsts = 6386
How is it that total number of instructions simulated is lower than
the total number of committed instructions? Also, shouldn't there be
some relation like, (commit_count + squashed_count  == sim_insts)?
regards,
Soumyaroop.
