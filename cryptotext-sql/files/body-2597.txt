Hi all:Does anyone succeed in SMT full system simulation with m5? I hope to run multithread benchmark in one cpu. Now I have two questions.(1)Does Splash support SMT? Is Splash a suitable benchmark in my case?
(2)How to make the configure file in full system mode to accomplish SMT simulation? I notice that many people simulate SMT in SE mode. But few people try it in FS mode.If anyone happens to have the similar idea,Â  please give me a share.
Thanks
