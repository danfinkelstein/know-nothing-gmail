Just to clarify, running scripts in SE in the same way that the .rcS
scripts are run under FS (i.e., inside the simulated system) only
makes sense if your goal is to use the python interpreter as a
benchmark.  Running in SE mode basically means you're running what
would be a single process in a real system.  If you want script-based
control over the process that gets run (which is what the .rcS file is
for) then you need to move that scripting code into your simulation
control script (e.g., se.py).
That said, if you want to run PARSEC, you're better off running in FS
mode anyway, since the single-process multithreading and inter-thread
synchronization support in SE mode is not really that great.  That's
why all the current work has been done in FS mode.
