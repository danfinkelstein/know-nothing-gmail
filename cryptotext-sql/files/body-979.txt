Hi all,I want to know the fraction of time spent in kernel/user modes for my application when doing my timing simulation.For my simulations, I fast forward a few hundred millions of instructions and then switch to detailed simulation.
I find in m5stats.txt that only "system.cpu<i>.kern.mode_ticks_kernel" entries have non-zero values, and "system.switch_cpus<i>.kern.mode_ticks_kernel" all have zero values.Could anyone please explain why this is so?
Thank you very much in advance!Best Regards,arun
