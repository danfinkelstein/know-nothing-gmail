Hi Richard,
Presently no. Most of the simulation work done with M5 is in full-system mode not syscall emulation mode. At some point I think there was a way to run some EIO traces through both threads of an smt.

Hi,
Just to be certain about this before I add support, there is really no way to simulate two threads on a SMT O3CPU with each thread starting at a different offest s(# of instructions into execution). You essentially have to run both threads on the cpu and suffer the different rates of execution of the different threads?
