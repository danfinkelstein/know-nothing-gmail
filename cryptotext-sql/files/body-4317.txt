Hi,
   I implement different page allocation algorithms(virtual to physical
address translation algorithm) based on current DRAM model in full
system(m5_2.0b). After running simulations(benchmark is ValStream), I
could see more than 20% difference in average DRAM access latency
within all these algorithms, but almost 0% difference in sim_ticks.
   Is that because the caculated dram latency is not used? Can anybody
explain that to me?
   Thanks.
Tracy
