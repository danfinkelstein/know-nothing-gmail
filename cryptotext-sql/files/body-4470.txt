The Alpha ISA has a load locked and a store conditional instruction which we support. Again I don't know exactly what you're doing to create your threads, but you need to make sure that their cpu/thread ids are unique. Are you scheduling each thread on it's own cpu or are they moving around? Ali- Show quoted text -On Jun 15, 2007, at 1:30 PM, Jiayuan Meng wrote:Hey all, By using the --trace-flags=Exec debug tool, I found that there is a race condition in the malloc function in my multithreaded program. However, when looking into the malloc.c in the glibc, it said it is a thread-safe version. I also noticed that in malloc/arena.c, it uses mutex_lock(), which seems to be a spinlock. This may still be problematic if several threads are accessing the lock simultaneously. So, what kind of synchronization support does M5 have in SE mode? Does it have store-conditional or test-and-set instructions or I'll have to add one myself? Thanks! Jiayuan_______________________________________________
