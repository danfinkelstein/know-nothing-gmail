OK, I'll take a look... I just hacked a randomized latency into
PhysicalMemory to try and reproduce the problem but it's still working
for me.  I'll run some longer tests to see if I can reproduce it.  If
not, would you be willing to send me your code so I can see if I can
track it down?
Also, what kind of memory hierarchy are you using (uni- vs
multiprocessor, # of cache levels, etc.)?
