Hi folks --I saw a couple threads on cache stats in m5 2.0b4, but didn't see these specific questions answered, and haven't seen this documented anywhere.It seems like the meaning of various cache stats -- "accesses", "mshr_hits", "mshr_misses", and so on -- have changed from b2 to b4, and I'm trying to figure out whether this was intentional since they appear (to me) to be less intuitive in b4.
In b4, requests first check the MSHR, and only check the full cache on an MSHR miss.  v2.0b2 worked in reverse -- requests first checked the cache, and only checked the MSHRs on a miss.  I assume this change was to avoid issues with pending coherence (S->E) upgrades (when the value exists in both the cache and the MSHR, but the MSHR might have the most up-to-date value).  Functionally, this seems to be fine.  From a stats point of view, however, it seems to have the following issues:
(1)  The cache_accesses stat does not report the total number of cache requests (as per, I believe, v2.0b2), but rather the total number of MSHR misses.  The total number of requests seems to only exist as "mshr_hits + mshr_misses".  (There is no mshr_accesses stat).
(2)  The mshr_misses stat does not provide any additional information -- it's always the same as cache_misses.At least to me, this is counter-intuitive -- I would expect "caches_accesses" to be the total number of requests (cache + MSHR), and for cache_misses = mshr_hits + mshr_misses.  I believe this is how b2 worked.  Am I missing something in the algorithm?  Is this one of the 'known issues' in the 2.0b4 release?
Thanks,    -Vilas
