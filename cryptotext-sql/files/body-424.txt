Hi, Steve. Thank you for your reply. I am now trying to implemente such an event like TickEvent to reschedule itselt at the end of every cycle. I hope this works as the data is quite intensive and the I/O device should have a pipeline to deal with the data that may arrive in every cycle. Thank you.

The right way to do this is to have the event reschedule itself everytime it runs for the proper latency until the next clock tick of the
device you're simulating.  (Note that you don't want to schedule every1 tick, you need to base the latency off a clock parameter.)  See theTickEvent in src/cpu/simple/atomic.{cc,hh} for an example; the event
gets rescheduled on the last line of the tick() function.Steve2010/3/12 Veydan Wu <veydanwu@gmail.com>:
