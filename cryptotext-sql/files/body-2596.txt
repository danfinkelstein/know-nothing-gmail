Both of these things would be rather easy.  The .ini thing would be
easier since this is already python.  The stats thing would be a
little bit more work though since it's in C++, though it would be
pretty easy to route the stats through python and I've had it on my
todo list for quite a long time.  I could probably do it in a day or
so and I've been meaning to fix it for quite some time..  Let me look
at it after we get this stable release out.
