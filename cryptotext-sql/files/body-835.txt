While we model EV5 PAL, we more or less model the EV67 ISA (though,
there may very well be missing instructions as you've mentioned.)  The
issues that you're seeing have more to do with the fact that most pal
instructions are serializing.  It's just never been anything that
we've decided to optimize.  Fixing it would likely require both
rewriting some of the palcode and changing the way that we deal with
the pal instructions in o3.
My first question is, why are you entering PAL so often?
