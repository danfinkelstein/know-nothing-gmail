Hi all,
I thought of running my own testcase written in C on the M5 (like a really short
and simple 'hello world'.c). However after I compiled (using gcc -static) and
ran it, it gave this error message:
command line: ../build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug --trace-flags=Fetch
../configs/example/se.py -c ./a.out
warn: Unknown architecture: 3
warn: More than two loadable segments in ELF object.
warn: Ignoring segment @ 0x0 length 0x0.
fatal: Object file architecture does not match compiled ISA (Alpha).
 @ cycle 0
[create:build/ALPHA_SE/sim/process.cc, line 395]
Memory Usage: 142992 KBytes
So I looked up crosstools and tried to d/l. Think it's going to take all night,
but in the meantime, is there any better way to do this? Is crosstools even the
right approach?
Any help is greatly appreciated!
Thanks,
Christopher
