  I added several new directories in /src/mem directory. In each new
directory, I added a SConscript file to declare this new added files.
Also I added new .py config files in /src/python/m5/objects and declare
this .py files in /src/python/SConscript.
  When I did some modification in some files and recompile them, I found
the whole M5 system was compiled! Did I miss something or make some
mistakes?
  Does anyone know what is the problem?
What files did you modify?  SCons tends to be very good about dependencies and doesn't rebuild stuff unless there is a reason.  You could also have a date issue on your machine.  Is your directory in NFS?  I don't think we're using signatures by default, but if the date thing is the problem, you can either fix your date, or turn on signatures.
