Hi Ali,
   Thank you very much for your reply. Could you please tell me how to use the trace-flag to see when the
kernel thread info struct changes from one thread to another thread?I mean which specific flag is for that.
   The reason that I think there are two cycle counts because each cpu has its own CPU cycles like
system.cpu0.numCycles. Except that we still have  sim_ticks which is nearly equal to the
system.cpu0.numCycles. And sim_seconds=sim_ticks/1THz. Since we only have CPU cycle counts,how
can we use it to be divided by the system frequency?
   Thanks a lot for your help.Best wishes to you!
                                                          Yue Li
