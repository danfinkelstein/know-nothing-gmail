Hi,
    I added some new files in m5/src/mem directory. In m5_2.0b1 version, I
 Add the files to the source list in the SConscript in the
m5/src/SConscript directory to compile these files into m5. But there is
no source list in this SConscript file in m5_2.0b3 version. What should I
do?
     I also got new python Objects defined. In m5_2.0b1 version, I should
edit src/python/m5/objects/__init__.py to include my Python file.
But in m5_2.0b3 version, there is __init__.py file in that directory. What
should I do?
 Thanks,
 Tracy
