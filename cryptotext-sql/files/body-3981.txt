How does one reset all statistics?
From C++ Stats::reset()
From python, m5.stats.reset()
From a benchmark, there's a statreset instruction (see util/m5)
From outside, kill -USR2 (though that will dump them too)
There are also similar mechanisms for dumping stats. Â Grep for reset in the tree will help you.- Show quoted text -
