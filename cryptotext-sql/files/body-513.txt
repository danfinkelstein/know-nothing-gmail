Hi Max,
Thanks for replying.
I have just compiled it in both the modes(FS and SE) with binaries as debug
and ran se.py and fs.py as sample tests.
However, I am not able to completely understand the slides and handouts on
the wiki.
I am at a beginner level. It would be a great help if you point some
pre-requisites which I need to
go through or study first before even coming up to using the simulator.
Thanks,
