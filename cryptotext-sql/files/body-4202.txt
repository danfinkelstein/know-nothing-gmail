here is some info on how to use linux-dist.http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Using_linux-dist_to_Create_Disk_Images_and_Kernels_for_M5
how did you create your .img file, and what did you do exactly to put your binaries on the image file?  did you try using linux-dist or did you mount the image and just copy them in?  the FAQ offers both possibilities.  the more specifics the easier it is to help.

Hi All,   In the answer to "How do I add files to a disk image?" on the FAQwebsite, I found "what you should do to add new binaries to M5 ismodify linux-dist and place it in that build structure."
   Can anybody explain these for me in detail? I put my created .img fileinto the "disks" directory which includes linux-latest.img &linux-bigswap2.img. I set the disk path in Syspath.py. But when I
connect to the simulated console, I cannot find the new binaries. Did Iput the .img file in the wrong place?Tracy_______________________________________________m5-users mailing list
