Hello there,Do the precompiled spec2000 binaries distributed with Simplescalar work with M5? The file information for the executables displays:"COFF format alpha executable paged not stripped - version 3.11-10"
There seems to have been some discussion regarding this in September of 2007 but I found out that the emails have been purged from the mail archive that is available online.regards,Soumyaroop.--
