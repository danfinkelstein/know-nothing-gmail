Hi,
I'm porting an in house ISA to the M5 simulator. The architecture contains
register windows. I'm wondering if anyone can explain in a little more
detail what the current procedure is for maintaining register windows
within the Sparc section of the code.
I can see the CWP manipulation in the save/restore and return(presumably a
rett?) operations. Having changed the CWP, by what process does a register
read, say, now fetch the value from the correct physical register?
Any help much appreciated, thanks.
Kind Regards,
Matt Horsnell
