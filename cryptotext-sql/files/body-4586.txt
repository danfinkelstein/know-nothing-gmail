You don't need that module... It is looking for a ipv6 kenel module, but it's not needed, however you do need the specweb fileset, but we can't distribute that because you need a license from SPEC to get it.

Thanks. Changing the path somehow solved the problem. But I still get the following error message after bootup on the server side (a similar thing shows up on the client side as well) I checked the lib folder on the image and there is no modules folder there. How can I get that?

Sorry about that, not sure how that happened.  the spec-surg-client.rcS file should have "cd /benchmarks/surge" instead of "cd benchmarks/specsurge" and i believe that should work.

    Hi
    I am trying to run specweb99 benchmarks with apache running on the
    server side.  I tried using "-b SurgeSpecweb", but it seems the latest
    linux disk image from the website doesn't have necessary files for
    running apache and also some paths are not set correctly in the
    spec-surge-server.rcS and spec-surge-client.rcS files. Are these
    scripts
    supposed to run with the latest disk image? Am I missing sth here?
    Thanks,
