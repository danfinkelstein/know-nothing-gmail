Hi all,
Background:
I would like to analyze the cold start effects of migrating a thread between two cpus by periodically jumping out of the simulate routine, writing all the caches (L1+L2) out to memory, and clearing the processor state (branch history tables, tlb entries, etc) and having the thread start in this cold state. By doing this cold start N times over a 100M instruction sample and looking at the average increase in execution time, this would give me the cold start effects of migration and I could just add a number of cycles for migrating ISA state (registers mostly) between two cores.
Questions:
1)What does m5.drain(testsys) do, as it is not obvious after diving in the code for a while and can it be used for clearing cache state?
2)Does anyone have an existing methodology for getting thread migration delay (between cores) in m5?
3)If no for 2, would anyone be interested in having support to find this delay?
-Rick
