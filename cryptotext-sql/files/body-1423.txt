You can try commenting out that assertion as a work-around, but to
solve the root of the problem you need to figure out why the number of
physical integer registers too low.
For instance, if 1 thread takes about 128 integer registers, then if
you are running more than 2 threads and dont have >= 256 registers
then there is no way the CPU will work.
More than likely, you need to increase that physical register
parameter listed above. Check src/arch/sparc/isa_traits.hh and various
files in that directory to find out the exact SparcISA::NumIntRegs
value.
