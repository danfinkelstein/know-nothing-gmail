Thanks for the reply. In my case, I am not attempting to debug with
GDB, so I guess something is attempting to connect to the GDB port. I
will try to track down the source. But in any case, what is the
cleanest way of disabling the gdb port? Can I simply set rgdb_enable
(in sim/system.cc) to false?
Thanks,
