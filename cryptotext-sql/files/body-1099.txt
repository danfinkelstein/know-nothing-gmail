Hi All:
    I am trying to use the Extra option in m5 to add some code that
doesn't have the right license for M5 (not yet, at least). The
tutorial on the website doesn't really say which I should put my code
in. I currently have the codes in a directory called
src/cpu/timing_trace but I am not sure if that is a good place. It is
not exactly clear from the tutorial
scons EXTRAS=/path/to/m5_2.0_encumbered build/ALPHA_SE/m5.opt
     Do I use the /path/to/m5_2.0_encumbered to point to my code or
just the m5 distribution in general? Thanks for any comment in
advance.
