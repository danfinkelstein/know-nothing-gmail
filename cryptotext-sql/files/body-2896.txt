Hi,
I downloaded the Splash2 binary from the M5 web site, and I tried to
run FFT with 256 CPUs. I had this message, "parmacs: too many
processes!", and the program terminated. Also, the Radix only supports
up to 64 CPUs. Is it possible to use more CPUs in Splash2 and SE mode?
Or how could I change it? My purpose is to study the relationship
between resource contention and scalability.
Many Thanks,
Meng-Ju
