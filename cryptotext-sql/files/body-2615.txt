Thanks for your response.I work on fs simulation. Is there any sample python config file in m5 like example/se.py to tell us how to set SMT? I assume it is a very different way to use SMT workloads in fs and se simulation.- Show quoted text -

Yes, and currently only O3 supports SMT.  For examples of how to use
it, look at the SMT regression test and configs/example/se.py
