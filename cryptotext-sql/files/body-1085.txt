I think that means the other busses have a default detault port, or in
other words if none of the ports connected to the bus with explicit
address ranges should receive a packet, it's interpreted as an error.
When there is something connected to the default port, I believe it's
usually to emulate the semantics of a particular type of bus like ISA or
PCI. If anyone knows differently please correct me.
