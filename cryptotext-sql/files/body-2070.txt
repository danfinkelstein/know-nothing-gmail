Dear Steve,
Thanks a lot for the reply and your suggestions. I went through the tutorial and
some codings. The component I am planning to write will have one port for cpu
side and one port for mem side and one method to modify the address(let say its
name is modify) something similar to the read and write methods in HelloDevice
in the tutorial (slides 108-113). The question I am having is who is going to
call my
function named 'modify' (same question i.e. who is going to call the read and
write method in the HelloDevice).
May be I am understanding the M5 concept in a wrong manner. I was thinking, that
cpu will send the packet to the cache calling a method or a constructor in
cache. But seems like that is not the case. Still wondering how the
interconnection among the methods in different classes are handled in M5.
Please bear with me if these questions are too newbie..
Thanks a lot for your kind concerns regarding this.
