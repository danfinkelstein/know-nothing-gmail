Hi,     I am using M5 to study cache coherence things. I am trying to use splash2 as benchmarks. But seems they are not easily compilable. I tried to link the kernels with pthread library. But that gives segamentation error when executed in the simulator. Does anyone have experience porting them on Linux?     Thanks,     Chenjie
