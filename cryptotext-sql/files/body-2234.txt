Hello,
I have installed bochs and now I have dllinux running and it using as
hard disk a file called hd10meg.img, the kernel is 1.3.89. So the
procedure that I should is: add my binary to the hd10meg.img and after
move the img to the simulator. Where should I put the binary in the
img? and Should I use another Linux with a 2.5 kernel?. Sorry for
bother you with this simple questions, but my Linux experience is not
very high. Thank you.
