   I added some new files in m5/src/mem directory. In m5_2.0b1 version, I
Add the files to the source list in the SConscript in the
m5/src/SConscript directory to compile these files into m5. But there is
no source list in this SConscript file in m5_2.0b3 version. What should I
do?
Things have been distributed.  Most files are listed in the SConscript file found in the directory where they were added.  (In some cases, they are in the parent.)  Take a loot in src/mem/SConscript or src/mem/cache/SConscript.
    I also got new python Objects defined. In m5_2.0b1 version, I should
edit src/python/m5/objects/__init__.py to include my Python file.
But in m5_2.0b3 version, there is __init__.py file in that directory. What
should I do?
That file is now automatically generated.  Just add the appropriate SimObject statement to src/python/SConscript.  (Just as a note, that in the next release of M5, these SimObject statements will also be distributed throughout the directory structure.)
