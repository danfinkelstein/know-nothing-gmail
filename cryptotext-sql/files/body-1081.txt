Hello,I am trying to run m5, and I am getting a
segfault during linux boot up. I am hoping anyone can give me any
advice and insight into fixing this error,as there are some issues with  the changes in my M5 version. Debug information is listed below including Trace Flags and GDB information:M5 output:397217555000: system.physmem: Read of size 8 on address 0x78c088 data 0x4180000010c
.....397217555000: system.membus: recvFunctional: packet src 4 dest -1 addr 0x4180000010c cmd ReadReq397217555000: system.membus: Unable to find destination for addr: 0x4180000010c, will use default portSegmentation Fault
GDB output:#0  0x00000000004c9bdc in Port::sendFunctional (this=0x0, pkt=0x7fffc259cd30) at build/ALPHA_FS/mem/port.hh:215  I am pretty inexperienced when it comes to M5, does anyone know anything else I can do to try to isolate the error and get more information in hopes of fixing it. The real issue is not the segfault, but the bad addr being received from physical memory.
Also shouldn't M5 stop running as soon as the destination is not found, as the membus does not have a default port, which is causing the seg fault.ThanksEF
