Hi everyone,
I would like to know how to use m5's MySQL functionality, which I believe
allows me to write simulation results into a MySQL database.
I wasn't able to find sufficient infos on this neither on the Wiki nor in the
Mailinglist - other than I need to compile in MySQL support, which I believe
I have done. But how do I tell m5 to dump the stats into the MySQL db? Where
do I specify host, database, user, password?
Thanks in advance for your help.
Best regards
Jonas.
