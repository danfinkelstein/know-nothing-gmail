The real question is: what do you want to access and why?
The SimObject parameters that you specify in python are handed off to
the corresponding objects in C++, so they are already there.  For
example, the C++ L2 cache object knows its size.  Some of the things
that aren't specifically passed as SimObject parameters are known in
C++ as well.  For example, the System object knows how may CPUs are in
the system it represents, and you can access that through the
getNumCPUs() method.
That said, the first thing you want to be sure of is that you really
need to access the variable from C++; it may be that it's easier to do
what you want to do in python anyway.  If you can be more specific
about your end goal then we can probably provide better advice.
