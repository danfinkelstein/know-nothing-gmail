Hi,
Thank you very much for your reply. I have been able
to run two programs in two different cores with the
help of your suggestion.
My objective is to run different threads of a
multi-threaded program in different cores. For this to
be done, do I have to use the full-system mode or the
system emulation mode ? And how can this be achieved
in either in M5 1.1 or M5 2.0 ?
