Hi,
 I've attached a modified cpu2000.py that I use. This 
incorporates changes that were discussed a while back (I think in 2007) by  
Vilas. I think the m5 repo did have those changes, but I dont see them in the 
latest version.
 
For some benchmarks, you have to use a specific name. Like for 
gzip, use gzip_source. for parser, use spec2000_parser (to avoid confusion with 
the M5 parser object).

  cpu2000.py
  Hi,I was looking in the archieve on how to use the 
  cpu2000.py file for spec2000benchmarks. Though I found some help from the 
  archieve, I was not able toget results using what was mentioned. I had 
  created the same file structurethat was mentioned in the 
  archieves.Unable to find workload for gzip. This is what that I can 
  see in the .e filewhen i run it..Thanks,
