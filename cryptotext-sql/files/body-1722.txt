Did this class derive from BaseCache?If so, then you are probably creating a new "SimObject" which gets instantiated via the swig-python(?)/Params interface.Look in src/mem/cache/builder.cc.
In there, you'll see a BaseCache "create()" function that is used to create a cache object with the typical M5 params.Somewhere, you are going to need a "create() function for you SimObject if you intend to be able to instantiate it through a config file.

Hi, all, I am confused of how to add new class to M5. When I added a new class called RaceCache in the src/mem/cache, and modified the SConscript and some other files, I got an compile error as followed:build/ALPHA_FS/libm5_opt.a(params_wrap.o): In function `_wrap_RaceCacheParams_create':
/m5-stable-733318abb7b1/build/ALPHA_FS/params/params_wrap.cc:31843: undefined reference to `RaceCacheParams::create()'collect2: ld returned 1 exit statusscons: *** [build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt] Error 1I am always confused with anything related to params, I think that may be a simple error because of my unfamiliarity of M5, can somebody give me some hints on how to deal with this ? Thanks !
