Incidentally, I've felt that this flag should be renamed to something
like Automatic, though I feel like we've been over that before.
I disagree... as Ali said, the addressing stuff is really a way to model broadcast in a fashion that doesn't require you to send every packet to every device on the bus.  That distinction shouldn't matter to you unless you're working with the bus at a relatively low level, as Shoaib is.
As far as Shoaib's problem, there does need to be exactly one device that is the target device for the address on the bus.  All the other devices can still see the packet if they register as snoop devices.  However you can't all register as snoop devices since someone has to be responsible for responding to the transaction even if none of the snoopers do.  Shoaib, if that's not enough to go on, you'll have to tell us more about how you want your various new cache ports to behave.
