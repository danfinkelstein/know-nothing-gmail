Hi all,
For the O3 cpu running several of the parsec benchmarks, let's focus on
x264 with 16 cores. I see that it's fetch unit requests 0xffffffc0 which
fails in the physmem because it is not within the valid address range
for the functional memory. The address is the result of  "iew: Execute:
Branch mispredict"  being detected and execute redirects fetch to PC:
0xffffffc0. This strange behavior does not occur when I use
SimpleTimingCPU. Is there any potential for the iew stage to redirect
fetch to a bogus address, that is inst->readNextPC() in iew_impl.hh
returns a bogus address that would propagate to the memory system and be
caught later?
Thanks in advance,
-Rick
