I just realized - I was talking in old habits and said something wrong - FullCPU is now deprecated and our latest OOO model is called O3CPU.  Lisa- Show quoted text -On 7/27/07,

Hi Lisa,
 
Thanks for you reply! I haven't go into non-blocking 
caches yet. I'll definitely following your pointer to the FullCPU core and look 
at how it is implemented.
 
Thanks!

  Hi 
  Jerry,Sorry this is so late - summer can be busy for everyone.  
  You may have figured this out already, but I'll answer just in 
  case.Since TimingSimpleCPU is an in-order core, making it non-blocking 
  doesn't make sense - you will still have to wait for the access can come back 
  before going on to the next instruction.  However, caches are 
  non-blocking for our FullCPU OOO core. Lisa

    Hey all,
     
    While looking at the cache-CPU 
    implementation in TimingSimpleCPU, it seems the current cache access is a 
    blocking access, isn't it? Is non-blocking cache access ever implemented in 
    any CPUs? If not, do you have any suggestions on how to implement it on M5 
    and its complexity?
     
    Thanks!
