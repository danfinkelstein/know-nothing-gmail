Hi all,
Can someone provide me more information on why branch instructions cause
the pipeline to be squashed starting from the decode unit?
I understand that a mispredicted branch should squash the pipeline when,
in the Ex-stage, it is known which path to take. However, when a branch
is predicted as "taken" there will allways be an additional squash (see
cpu/inorder/resources/fetch_seq_unit.cc, function "execute", case
"UpdateTargetPC").
A couple of weeks ago I posted a patch for the inorderCPU's branch
predictor, where I also mentioned a problem with squashing.
I mentioned that sometimes there were multiple squashes that tried to
remove 2 times the same entry in the predHist-table.
Greets,
Max
