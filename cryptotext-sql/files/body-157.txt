The first step to getting the O3 CPU to work is to get the timing CPU to
work. It's probably a rather trivial fix, but the issue is where the fix
should go. I imagine it has something to do with interrupts or timers
(TICK/STICK compare), but exactly what is wrong I don't know. It's kind of
hard know how long it will take to find the problem. Some issues can be
tracked down rather quickly with the tracing built into M5, but since the
interrupts are going to happen on different instructions because of the
timing involved it's a bit trickier.
Someone else on the mailing list would know better than I what it would
take to make the O3 CPU work with SPARC_FS. Gabe did you changes for
SPARC_SE o3 ever get merged into the repository? That seems like it would
be the first step. Anyone else want to jump in?
Thanks,
Ali
