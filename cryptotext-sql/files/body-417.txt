Hi, Steve. Thank you for your reply. You provide a good way to use in simulation. I have one more question. I want to simulate the I/O device executing in parallel with the CPU. In verilog, we have the always statement which keeps the device running all the time. How can I find a loop in the simulation to put the main function of the device?
 
The simulate() seems only serve events, without the knowledge of specific object. I think there must be a natural way to keep the device running as in verilog. How should I implement this in M5? Thank you!

If you have another object that needs to know about your new object,the easiest thing is to add a parameter to the other object so that
you can pass the new object in:class OldObject:   myObject = Param.SimObject("ptr to my object")You can then read the C++ object pointer out of the C++ old object'sparam struct.
There's also a SimObject::find() function that lets you find objectsby name, but it's really for debugging and not for normal programmaticusage.Steve
