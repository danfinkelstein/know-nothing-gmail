Jerry,
 
Can you provide the users list with the exact requirements for
your experiments you wish to run? That will make it easier to give you help.

Is there a better way to get these stats after very
cycle, if I can not dump all these stats? I only need few stats such
as cache hits to analyze the runtime characteristic. Thanks.

If you just need aggregate
stats at the end of the simulation run, such as number of dcache.ReadReq_hits,
M5 already does this.  When the simulation finishes, it dumps the file:
m5stats.txt to your current working directory with everything added up for you.
 
Dumping stats every cycle can
easily lead to multi gigabyte files that will be very hard to work with and
store.

Hi, Lisa
 
I only need few stats to analyze the runtime characteristics of an
application. For example the number of dcache.ReadReq_hits,
icache.ReadReq_hits, etc. I added these
codes  "Stats::StatEvent(true,false);" in function
simulate(Tick num_cycles) located simulate.cc. But I didn't get the result
I wanted. Could you tell me what is the correct way to get thest stats? Thank
you very much!

doing this will result in millions of large
files full of stat text - what is it that you want this for?

Hi,
 
I want to dump m5stats after per cycle. I've looked up the code. Maybe
I can add some codes in function simulate(Tick num_cycles) located
simulate.cc. Fox example, add a StatEvent like
"Stats::StatEvent(true,false);" in this function? But I'm not sure
how to do it correctly. I'm using m5sim 2.0b5 in SE model.  What
is the correct way to get this information? Thanks!
