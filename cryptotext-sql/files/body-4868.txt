you need to #include "base/trace.hh"- Show quoted text -
I was try to insert DPRINTF
In file  /mem/cache/coherence/coherence_protocol.cc,  (m5_1.1)
bool
CoherenceProtocol::invalidateTrans(BaseCache *cache, MemReqPtr &req,
                                  CacheBlk *blk, MSHR *mshr,
                                  CacheBlk::State & new_state)
{
   new_state = (blk->status & ~stateMask) | Invalid;
   return false;
}
I was trying to insert
   DPRINTF(Cache, "invalidate");
before return false statement
So that I am notified of cache invalidation.
When I try to build that, I got the following error:
g++ -o ALPHA_SE/mem/cache/coherence/coherence_protocol.o -c -pipe -fno-strict-aliasing -Wall -Wno-sign-compare -Wundef -g -O5 -DSS_COMPATIBLE_FP -Iext/dnet -IALPHA_SE -Im5 m5/mem/cache/coherence/coherence_protocol.cc

scons: *** [ALPHA_SE/mem/cache/coherence/coherence_protocol.o] Error 1
scons: building terminated because of errors.
I think this is because I used DPRINTF. printf works, but I still want to know what's wrong with DPRINTF.

printf works though, but I need to also get the cycle number and
processor number to analyze the printed trace, which comes naturally
with DPRINTF
Does any one know how to do that?
What exactly is your problem?  In order to use dprintf, you need to
compile either debug or opt (not fast), and turn on some trace flags.
running m5 with --help should give you some info.  The debugging page on
the documentation section of the wiki has a bit more info.
