Hi all,
I've been having some problems building m5 today. There were only two possible
major changes I did that could have caused it. One, I installed crosstools.
Two, due to speed reasons I tried building m5.opt/debug on 64 bit machines. For
some reason, not only did that not work, but now I can't even get m5.opt/debug
to build on 32 bit machines anymore. Here are the error messages:
For ALPHA_FS/m5.opt:
build/ALPHA_FS/base/stats/events.o: file not recognized: File format not
recognized
For ALPHA_FS/m5.debug:
build/ALPHA_FS/cpu/base.do: file not recognized: File format not recognized
For ALPHA_SE/m5.opt:
build/ALPHA_SE/base/stats/events.o: file not recognized: File format not
recognized
For ALPHA_SE/m5.debug:
build/ALPHA_SE/mem/physical.do: file not recognized: File format not recognized
I'm pretty sure it was working last week and I could build w/o any problems. And
I didn't make any changes to any file either. Would installing crosstools do
anything that could mess up m5? Or would running on 64bit machines accidentally
change any configurations that needs resetting when I go back to 32bit? Any help
would really be a godsend.
Thanks,
Christopher
