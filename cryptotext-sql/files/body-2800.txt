You could also create a new SimObject which has all the information you
want stored in it. SimObjects are how components of a simulation, both
concrete and abstract, are represented in python and at a higher level
in C++. The C++ representation of a SimObject is populated using the
values in the python representation, so you can store the values you're
interested in in the python SimObject before starting up the simulation.
Then have your C++ code refer to it's copy to get the values back out.
There are lots of examples of SimObjects in M5 which should get you
started. If you look around the source tree, the files which define the
python version of SimObjects are .py files mixed in with the .ccs and
.hhs. Unfortunately I don't think there's any documentation specifically
about how to make you're own SimObjects (someone please correct me if
I'm wrong), but it's more straightforward than it used to be so you
hopefully won't have too much trouble. To see what basic types of
parameters there are you should look in src/python/m5/params.py.
