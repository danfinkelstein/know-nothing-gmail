Hi Nate,
     I didnt understand what you mentioned about connecting a disk model
directly to the real image.
The lines from fsconfig.py are:
self.disk0 = CowIdeDisk(driveID='master')
    self.disk2 = CowIdeDisk(driveID='master')
    self.disk0.childImage(mdesc.disk())
    self.disk2.childImage(disk('linux-bigswap2.img'))
    self.tsunami = BaseTsunami()
    self.tsunami.attachIO(self.iobus)
    self.tsunami.ide.pio = self.iobus.port
    self.tsunami.ethernet.pio = self.iobus.port
    self.simple_disk = SimpleDisk(disk=RawDiskImage(image_file =
mdesc.disk(),
                                               read_only = True))
Do I only need to change the last read_only to 'false'? How do I connect the
disk model directly to the real image?
Thanks,
Sujay
