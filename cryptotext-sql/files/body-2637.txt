M5 doesn't expose statistics about the kernel's paging.  M5 doesn't
actually know anything about the kernel paging at all, from the
simulator's perspective, there's just disk accesses and memory
accesses and there's no notion of what they were for.  You can of
course add a tiny bit of code to the kernel paging daemon to tell M5
about paging so it can keep statistics, but unless you really need a
simulator you're probably better of just running experiments on a real
machine and restricting the memory.
