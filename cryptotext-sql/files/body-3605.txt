If it's timing, it will have to be event-driven and incremental.  Even
if you bypass the local cache's write buffer, there will possibly be
other finite write buffers down the line (e.g. if you are flushing an
L1, the L2 could stall on you).  So you might as well just use the
existing ports and buffers.
Once you bite the bullet and set up the framework for an event-driven
incremental flush, it's not that bad.  But it's still way harder than
just writing a simple loop like you could if you use functional
accesses.
In what environment do you want to flush the cache and care about the
timing impact of actually performing the flush?
Another (even more realistic) approach is to add some magic addresses
to flush individual lines, then do it in software on the CPU (just
like how you would do it on a real machine).
