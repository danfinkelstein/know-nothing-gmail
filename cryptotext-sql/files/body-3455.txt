Are you trying to import config files from m5.1.1 to m5 2.0?All the common config files are moved to the m5/configs/* directory.
Things like Caches.py are found in the configs/common directory.If you are trying to import from a previous M5, realize that you mightnot be able to copy your config files over and change where thelocation of objects are find.
So hopefully, if you are using m5.2.0 then you are using pythonconfiguration files based off the configs/example/se.py file insteadof some other file or you will probably run into problems.
