Hi Sheng,  I'm not exactly sure what the problem is here, but it could be the case that the Linux kernel that you are using will only support 4 cores.  There is a Linux kernel supporting up to 64 cores on our website that you can try to see if that fixes the issue: http://userweb.cs.utexas.edu/~cart/parsec_m5/.
  Good luck,  Joel- Show quoted text -On Mon, Apr 26, 2010 at 3:27 PM, sheng qiu <herbert1984106@gmail.com> wrote:
- Show quoted text -hi Joel,now it's ok when the core number is no more than 4. but when i set more than 4 cores, it will show information: clear IPI for CPU #num, but NO IPI all the time. and the system.terminal shows that the booting stopped at this process:
Slave CPU 4 console command STARTSlaveCmd: restart FFFFFC0000310020 FFFFFC0000310020 vptb FFFFFFFE00000000 my_rpb FFFFFC0000018B80 my_rpb_phys 18B80is there anything wrong? i download the disk image of PARSEC from the website:http://userweb.cs.utexas.edu/~cart/parsec_m5/
