The python library must be the same python library as the one being used to execute scons.  If you have two installation paths of python (example /usr/local/lib and /usr/lib) you need to make sure that you use the same version to run scons.   To verfiy the installation type "which python" to find what version of python is being used and then change the default path to python to point to that version.

Hello,I am getting an error on compiling the M5 simulator where it is unable to properly recognize python 2.4 that is installed.  I am compiling on a FreeBSD platform, version 6.4 I believe.  I have confirmed that /usr/lib/libpython2.4.so exists and yet for some reason, on compile I still get the following error.  Please help....
