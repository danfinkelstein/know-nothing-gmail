Hi William,
In Meng's patches, you can change the code to schedule/deschedule the
threads as you want. It can give you a very precise control on thread
scheduling. If you want to pollute the L2,  you can just spawn two
threads on two different cores and suspend one. Then you can
deschedule the first thread and active the second one.
