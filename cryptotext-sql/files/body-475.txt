systems call can be tracked using the stat.txt outputsearch for things such as:system.cpu0.kern.syscall::73                        1      0.00%      0.01% # number of syscalls executedthese numbers can be traced searching from system call tables. using an alpha cross compiler  or the linux kernel source code (or google you can trace these calls.)
system call macros usually have the prefix "__NR_"- Show quoted text -On Wed, Feb 10, 2010 at 6:07 PM, ef <snorlaxgb@gmail.com> wrote:
Hello,
I am running a program where I noticed that 50% of M5 execution time is spent in the kernel. Looking at the program, I cannot find reasons why this would be the case (4 threads, where there is very little communcation between threads). Anyone have any idea on how to trace the instruction callsys,and see what system calls are made?
 
I see a huge amount of callsys, swpipl, rti instructions being executed!
 
 
Thanks,
EF
