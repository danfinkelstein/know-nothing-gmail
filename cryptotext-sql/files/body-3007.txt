I even went back and started from scratch with 2.0b4. The exact commands I
used were:
% scons build/ALPHA_FS/m5.debug
% build/ALPHA_FS/m5.debug configs/example/fs.py
So, could there be a bug in the Full System Files with the pre-compiled
Linux kernel? I've made no modifications to any of the files. I'm surprised
no one has tested this since running the full system mode seems like a
common task.

I believe that it gets the disk size from the disk image itself.  Can
you make sure that you have proper access to the disk image and that
you are pointing to the right thing?  the config.ini file is a good
place to look.
