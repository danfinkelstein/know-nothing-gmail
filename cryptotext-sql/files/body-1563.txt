Hi Javier,Look in commit_impl.hh and you'll see a wire named "fromRename"... that sends instructions to the commit stage which puts them in the ROB. In commit_impl.hh, look for a function called "getInsts" that calls "rob->insert()". That's where entries get allocated I assume. Try to follow the function traces from there and see what you come up with.
A good debugging tool is to run a simple hello world program and only turn on the trace flags that matter to you...For instance:O3CPU - provides spaces every tick/general cpu infoRename - rename/dispatch info
Commit - information about rob/committing insts...Not sure if there is a explicit ROB flag but double-check that.Hope that helps,Korey- Show quoted text -On Mon, Apr 20, 2009 at 5:48 PM, Javier Jose <javier.jose@gmail.com> wrote:
- Show quoted text -Hi everyone,I am currently implementing a dynamic adaptive partitioning of ROB for SMT, but I have a question concerning ROB enrtry allocation.
Is the ROB entry allocated in M5 during dispatch? I expected to be so, but after looking at the code in O3, specifically iew_impl.hh, commit_impl.hh and rob_impl.hh, I don't see any communication or "wire" when dispatch is executed to instruct the commit module to insert the instruction in the ROB. "In the other direction" I see only the commit_impl.hh inserting ( and allocating entries for) instructions into the ROB during the commit() function, it says it checks for ready instructions from the rename module for the next cycle, but I am not sure of the mechanics. 
Another way of asking this can be: If an instruction in inside the ROB, managed by numInstsInROB, is it or is not in the IQ/LSQ (else it is already "issued/executing")?I'd appreciate any help,
Javier
