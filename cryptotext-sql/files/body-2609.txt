Philip,
I think that is a pretty reasonably idea, however as you state the con
is reasonably high. I don't think we would want to distribute them
with M5 proper, because it would be difficult to verify that all the
configurations still work. I think the best option is to have a
contribution section on the wiki. People could post full scripts, or
snippets along with information and comments. I don't think file
uploading is enabled on the website at this moment, but I'll work on
making that happen.
