Looks like it was a problem with using the wrong PAL.  Turns out that
tsb_osfpal isn't in the m5_system_2.0b3 tarball, and the one in
zizzer:/z/m5/system/stable is broken (out of date).  We've got the one
from /dist/m5/system now and it seems to be working.
I'll put a link up on the wiki for the working tsb_osfpal.
