Are there any limitations on what objects can be used as SimObjectParams? For my case, I want to Â pass an AlphaO3CPU pointer to another object I constructed through the python configurations. Originally I had:
SimObjectParam<AlphaO3CPU<AlphaSimpleImpl> *> thecpu
as my parameter definition, but this gave an error complaining that there was no
ShowType(std::basic_ostream<char, std::char_traits<char> >&) const
method defined for that object. Same goes for just trying to use the BaseO3CPU object. On the other hand, BaseCPU works fine.
So what is it about BaseCpu that doesn't cause this error? From what I can tell, the ShowType method is defined in param.hh for all SimObjectParam, regardless of what the templated object is. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place, or missing something.
