Hello, I am implementing DRAMSim in m5, as it says here:
 
http://osdir.com/ml/emulators.m5.devel/2008-07/msg00146.html
 
But I have a problem related with the scheduling of events in the DRAM, the problem comes with this line
 
memCtrlEvent->schedule(0);
 
This is the definition of memCtrlEvent
 
typedef EventWrapper<DRAMMemory, &DRAMMemory::processMemCtrlEvent>  MemCtrlEvent;
 
The problem is that the class EventWrapper has changed in the lasts versions of M5, and now in the class EventWrapper there is no schedule method. So my question is how can I schedule the packects now?. If someone is interested I can submit the patches for the implementation, if finally works.
 
Thank you so much.Comparte tus fotos con tus amigos. Más fácil con  Windows Live
