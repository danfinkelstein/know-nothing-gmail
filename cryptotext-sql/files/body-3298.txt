Hi Giang,
I would recommend using the mercurial linux repository and the patch queue provided. If you can't do that then you should apply all the patches in the order that they're listed in the series file. The comment after the patch describes what version of the kernel that patch is for.
Additionally, you'll need to compile the PAL code with the big tsunami options. Without those changes the kernel will be unable to sent interrupts to > 4 processors.

Hello,
I am currently able to run m5 in full system mode with 4 processors.  However, I cannot yet get it run with 8 processors.  I have looked through previous threads and found some suggestions on how to fix this problem.  However, there are things that are not clear to me.  So I hope someone would clarify these.
First, I found recommendations that I should compile the kernel 2.6.13 downloaded from m5 web site rather than the stock kernel.  But I cannot find a link to this kernel source from m5 website?
I tried compiling with the kernel 2.6.13 that I downloaded from kernel.org instead.  I found patches to allow more than 4 processors from m5 web site, however, I am not sure which one I should apply?  Is it necessary to set up a mercurial repository in order to apply these patches?  If I apply all of them using the patch command, the kernel fails to compile.  I could compile the kernel when I applied only the patches bigtsunami_2.6.13.diff, bigtsunami.diff, defaultconfig_2.6.13.diff and a few other patches.  However, m5 does not fully boot.  Here are the last few output I had before the program stalled:

Please give some suggestions on how to fix this problem
Thank you very much.
