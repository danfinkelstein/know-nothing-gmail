Just in case anyone else was paying attention to this thread, the resolution to this problem was just the difference in code between m5-stable and m5-inorder.The reference inorder pipeline for the m5-stable model had been allowing ALU instructions to execute in stage 2 (immediately after decode) whereas the m5-dev reference pipeline had ALU instructions execute in stage 3. - Show quoted text -

Okay, but this extra cycle is only visible when there is a dependent
instruction directly following the multiply. So when I set the multiply
latency for example to 3, the latency is 3 when no dependent instruction
is immediately following this multiply. If there actually is a dependent
instruction immediately following the multiply, the latency would be 4.

The same holds here: an independent instruction following the load can
already be in stage 3 (MEM) when the load is in stage 4 (WB).
A dependent instruction directly following the load is in stage 1 (ID)
when the load is in stage 4.
It makes sense that there is an extra stall-cycle because the data
returns in cycle 3, but here there are two extra stall-cycles accounted
in stead of one.
Thanks,
Max
