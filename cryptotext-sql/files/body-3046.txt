I thought it was, but it turns out it's x86/64, as is the 4.1 version of the alpha compiler.

Hi,
At the risk of sounding like a complete noob, are the cross-compilers
listed on the download page built for the x86 linux platform? I have
downloaded the SPARC64 cross-compiler from this page and tried to run
them on my x86 Ubuntu Linux system, but they do not execute. I even
tried loading one of the files using gdb, but the debugger complained
that the files are not in executable format.
I apologize for barging in on this conversation, but my problem seemed
very similar and I thought I would use the same thread.
Thanks,
Sherif Fadel

There is a cross compiler available on the Download page. You could
just use that one if you don't want to compile one yourself. If you do
then follow Nick's advice and figure out why CFLAGS has been set.

Hello
I am trying to run an simple c program in ALPHA_FS mode, so I need
to cross compile the program and put it on.
I follow every step mentioned in the document, but it could not work.
I have done the following step:
1.      Untar the crosstool tarball
2.      Change the “eval” line in demo-alpha.sh parameter to ‘cat
alpha.dat gcc-3.4.3-glibc-2.3.5.dat’
3.      Change the LINUX_DIR to “linux-2.6.13” in gcc-3.4.3-
glibc-2.3.5.dat
4.      Run sh demo-alpha.sh
When the script finished with some messages, there is nothing under /
opt/crosstool/gcc-3.4.3-glibc-2.3.5/alpha-unknown-linux-gnu/
Does anyone know what the problem is?
Here is the output message from the script:

You set both LINUX_DIR and LINUX_SANITIZED_HEADER_DIR - ignoring
LINUX_DIR
GCC_CORE_DIR not set, so using gcc-3.4.3 for bootstrap compiler
BINUTILS_EXTRA_CONFIG not set, so not passing any extra options to
binutils' configure script
GCC_EXTRA_CONFIG not set, so not passing any extra options to gcc's
configure script
GLIBC_EXTRA_CONFIG not set, so not passing any extra options to
glibc's configure script
GLIBC_EXTRA_ENV not set, so not passing any extra environment
variables to glibc's configure script
GLIBC_EXTRA_CC_ARGS not set, so not passing any extra options to gcc
when building glibc
EXTRA_TARGET_CFLAGS not set, so not passing any extra cflags to gcc
when building glibc
USE_SYSROOT not set, so not configuring with --with-sysroot
GCC_BUILD not set, assuming BUILD=output of config.guess
GCC_HOST not set, assuming HOST=BUILD
SHARED_MODE not set, so defaulting to --enable-shared
GLIBC_ADDON_OPTIONS not set, so guessing addons from
GLIBCTHREADS_FILENAME and GLIBCCRYPT_FILENAME
crosstool: Don't set CFLAGS, it screws up the build
