> What is Squashed flag used for?
If you squash an event, that means that it is not removed from the
event queue, but it will not be run when the event's timer expires.
This is an optimization because removal from the event queue is O(N).

There is currently one event queue, but I plan to allow each object to
use a different event queue.  This is a step in the direction of
parallelizing the simulator.
