Some of the rcs files contain the loadsymbol 
command. Are the .symbol files like a table 
between the source code on the debugger host side and the addresses on the 
target? What exactly does it do? I can see symbol files only 
for some of the spec2K benchmarks, not for others. Is it required only if 
running m5.debug?
