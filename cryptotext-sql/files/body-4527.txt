Hello,
      I want to try and 
model a multicore architecture in M5. As example system would be:
 
4 cores (lets say alpha)
private L1 caches, shared L2
DRAM model (RDRAM or SRAM, with power modes 
control)
 
I want to build this configuration, and run 
benchmark tests on this, and tweak the power mode transitioning for the DRAM 
modules, to see what policy works best in achieving low power.
 
So, what I want to know is:
1) Can I model such a system?
2) Do DRAM models already exist for 
M5?
3) Will it be possible to migrate pages 
from one DRAM rank to another?
4) Can I get traces if the pages accessed most 
frequently by tests like splash, or spec2000?
 
Thanks,
Sujay
