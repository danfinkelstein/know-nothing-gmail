Nope, m5 is all straight-up C++ and Python with no host architecture dependences.  So you can boot Solaris on a simulated SPARC with m5 running on an x86 host just fine.  It's even in our regression tests; just give scons this argument:
build/SPARC_FS/tests/fast/long/80.solaris-boot/sparc/solaris/t1000-simple-atomicThe only situation where there's any host dependence at all is endianness, and that's just a matter of testing.  So while both big- and little-endian targets work fine on little-endian hosts (since we do practically all our development on x86), there may be lurking bugs if you try and run a little-endian target on a big-endian host (like x86 on SPARC).  But those would be bugs and not design dependencies.

Thanks Ali.  I think I understand now. You're referring to what's being
modeled, not the type of processor you need to run the simulation.  But
I'm assuming that parts of the full system simulation still require
specific properties of the host, even though it's not native execution.
So for example, I assume that even with a full system simulation model,
I couldn't run M5 on an X86 and simulate Niagara.  Or could I?

P.S.  I know we've exchanged a lot of emails on this, and I really
appreciate your patience.
