Hi Jie,  That's correct, assuming you're using writescripts.pl from our website to generate your M5 run scripts.  Joel- Show quoted text -

Hi Joel,I'm also using PARSEC on M5 FS mode. And my stats.txt has four parts.As far as I understand, they are:
1) Statistics for M5 full system booting up2) Statistics before reaching ROI3) Statistics in the ROI4) Statistics dumped when M5 exitsAnd we're interest in the multi-thread parallel running part. So I believe part 3) is what we should focus on. Am I right?
And hope this could provide some comparable information to Sheng too.Thank,JieOn Apr 27, 2010, at 3:23 PM, Joel Hestness wrote:
Hi Sheng,  If you are using the disk image from our website, the benchmarks are compiled to dump M5 statistics before and after the computational region of interest of the benchmark, and the simulation dumps statistics when it exits.
  I would encourage you to read through section 6.5 our technical report, in particular the part about M5 hooks, for more information on what your simulations are doing.  Good luck,  Joel

Hi all,when i running PARSEC on M5 FS mode, the simulation results of each application has three parts of the following sections ---------- Begin Simulation Statistics ----------...............................
......................---------- End Simulation Statistics   ----------my script is:#!/bin/sh# File to run the blackscholes benchmarkcd /parsec/install/bin/sbin/m5 resetstats./blackscholes 1 /parsec/install/inputs/blackscholes/in_4K.txt /parsec/install/inputs/blackscholes/prices.txt
/sbin/m5 exitSo why there are three statistics in one application result? which one is the benchmark simulation result? maybe my question is a little trivial.Thanks,Sheng
