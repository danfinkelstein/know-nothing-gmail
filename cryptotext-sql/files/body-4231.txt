Hi all,I'm new to M5 and also relatively new to linux.  I have a question about an installation problem and about using M5 on VMWare.1) I tried installing M5 with the instructions given.  I have scons-0.97
, SWIG1.3.31, and Python 2.5.1 and all seemed to install fine.  Here is the output:$ scons build/ALPHA_SE/tests/debug/quickscons: Reading SConscript files ...Checking for C header file Python.h... yesAdding /usr/local/lib to LIBPATH for 
python2.5Checking for C library python2.5... noError: can't find Python library python2.52) Has anyone installed M5 on a VM? My laptop can't install linux (hpdv6000s have problems w/ linux) and I was thinking to just do it through ubuntu run on VMware player.  Has anyone done something similar?  How is performance?  Are there compatibility issues?
Any help on the two issues would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.Julian B.
