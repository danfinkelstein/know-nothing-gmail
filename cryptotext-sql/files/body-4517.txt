Happily, if you add an instruction to the decoder all the CPU models will be
able to execute that instruction. Now adding vector registers is going to be
a bit more complex since we don't have explicitly vector registers (The
vector ops on SPARC and Alpha use FP registers). You'll probably have to
duplicate all the setXXXReg(),
readXXXReg() methods in the CPU models but this time for a vector register
file. (See thread_context.hh and simple_thread.hh)

Yes they can.
