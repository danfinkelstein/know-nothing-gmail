Hello all,
I am building M5 on ubuntu7.10 and my input is as follows:
sudo scons build/alpha_se/m5.fast
The error is:
.....
configure: error: can not find sources in /home/xx/m5/ext/libelf
scons: *** [build/libelf/lib/libelf.a] Error 256
scons: building terminated because of errors.
Can anybody tell me how to fix it? Thanks.
Xin
