Hello all,
In the cpu2000.py script, there is an "output" attribute to each
benchmark object. What is its purpose? It does not seem to be the name
of the file that the stdout should be directed to because the stdout
seems to be getting directed to "simout" by default. Nor does it seem
to the gold output that the output produced during a benchmark run
should be compared with.
regards,
Soumyaroop.
