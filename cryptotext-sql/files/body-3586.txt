Hi Sujay,Sorry, I had a busy week.  I can execute applu, apsi, art110, equake, lucas, wupwise, bzip2_program, gzip_graphic, gzip_source, mcf, parser, perlbmk_makerand, twolf, and vortex2.  Again, I believe m5 v2b4 can execute the full set of spec2k benchmarks with the patches that have been sent to the mailing list.  These are using the ref input sets.
I'm using the standard se.py file that comes with m5 -- I've got some local mods, but nothing that affects the execution of these benchmarks.In terms of where to get the alpha-compiled benchmarks, I got them a long time ago -- if you have a SPEC license, you should be able to compile your own.  There used to be a set of compiled ALPHA benchmarks posted on the web (from Chris Weaver), but I don't know if they are posted any more.

  Hi Vilas,
      Can you tell me which 
  benchmarks are you able to execute? And can you send me your config file for 
  running them?
  Where did you download the alpha compiled 
  benchmarks from?
   
  Thanks,
  Sujay

    problems
    Hi Sujay,I can do a subset of spec2k.  
    I haven't tried Spec2k6.  Rick Strong has been working on getting 
    Spec2k working -- see the mailing list archives, but I think he's figured 
    out pretty much all the problems and posted diffs.  I haven't yet tried 
    it.   -Vilas

      Hi Vilas,
             Are you 
      able to run spec 2000 or spec 2006 in M5?

        Re: [m5-users] ALPHA SE Spec2k problems
        Hi Rick,It think it may be the input file 
        names.  Many of the SPEC2k benchmarks get input files redirected to 
        their STDIN.  For example, parser has the following command line 
        (from http://kbarr.net/specint2000-commandlines):    
        parser 2.1.dict -batch < ref.in > ref.out 2> ref.errI think this 
        code in cpu2000.py provides the input files to STDIN for many of these 
        benchmarks:        if not 
        hasattr(self.__class__, 
        'stdin'):            
        self.stdin = joinpath(inputs_dir, '%s.in' % self.name)            
        if not 
        isfile(self.stdin):                
        self.stdin = NoneIt looks to me like, unless otherwise 
        specified, parser would get a STDIN of filename "parser.in".  Since this 
        is (likely) not a file in your SPEC directory, parser probably doesn't 
        get a proper input file.  I don't see anywhere else that the 
        self.stdin parameter is set for parser in cpu2000.py either.If 
        this is the problem, renaming (or copying and renaming) the ref.in file as "parser.in" would solve the 
        problem, or else add the line: 
                self.stdin = 'ref.in'...to the 
        cpu2000.py where it sets up the "parser" benchmark.Specifically, 
        I believe I've gotten parser to run by doing the former (creating a file 
        parser.in).  I haven't 
        tried facerec or the others you mention, but according to Ken's website, 
        they all are similar (taking either ref.in or inp.in on their STDIN).

          I had to make a wild guess, I think you may be having problems 
          withinput or output files not being accessible, or maybe being 
          corrupted.I'm not sure what compiler your binaries were 
          compiled with, or if fortran error numbers are standardized, but 
          error 24 is "End-of-fileduring read" for DEC Fortran:http://www.helsinki.fi/atk/unix/dec_manuals/df90au52/dfum033.htm 
          The rest of that error message just says that it tried to 
          look up thetext error message for that error number but couldn't 
          find the filethat does that.SImilarly with lucas, if the 
          program is calling exit() after 80K instructions it's because 
          something very early went wrong, like itdidn't like the 
          command-line arguments or couldn't find an input file. I'm 
          very surprised you're not getting an error message somewhere (from 
          the app if not from m5).That reminds me... could the 
          command-line arg issues we were havingwith the splash scripts 
          (where you need to manually split the commandline into args) be an 
          issue here too? Steve
