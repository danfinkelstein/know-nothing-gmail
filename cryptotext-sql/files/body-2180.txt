Hi Sujay,
Thanks for the response. Even I initially thought that cpu_ratio is
being used to normalize the difference in CPU and memory speeds. But,
it seems the "lat" in this function is calculated in terms of
simulation ticks, which is the number of 1THz cycles of M5. So in that
case it should be actually independent of the fact that the memory
operates at a slower speed than the CPU.
Please correct me if my understanding is wrong here.
Thanks,
-Gaurav
