What is the significance of default port? I have a bus with four caches and one bridge connected to it. When I printed port ids (by iterating over the interfaces data structure), the four mem_side ports of caches have ids 0,1,2,3 wit 4 as default port. Now I am receiving a pcket on that bus with src 4 dest 0. Is it safe to assume the 4 as the bridge_port?
