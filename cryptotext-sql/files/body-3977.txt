Subject: Re: [m5-users] suppressing exit callback function when aborted- Show quoted text -
     I am using an exit callback function to print out stats in a file. This is working fine. However, if m5 aborts for some reason, the function still gets called at the end, printing out garbage values. Can I suppress the calling of this function (based on some error code?)
There is currently no support for this since it's basically just adding somethign to an atexit handler.
