Hi Everyone,I know this question has been asked frequently now, but after looking through tons of documentation and the mail-archive threads I am still not clear at all how to get SPEC CPU2000 working on M5. Is it possible to find a complete guideline/how_to that explains from source_code -> running (at least in SE)? 
I have the CD and downloaded everything to my Ubuntu VM (where I have M5). Since I've always used pre-compiled spec binaries I have never tried to cross-compile the source code and it seems that a bunch of tools are needed for it (for which the installation fails on my system) even if I just want to cross-compile the source code using the alpha-gcc cross compiler given the M5 wikipage. 
Thefore, in the case that i can't be redirected to a guidelin/how_to of some sort, does anyone know how to succesfully do the following?:1) Cross-compile SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks for ALPHA or at least get the binaries.
2) Run SPEC CPU 2000 in SE. Since I don't have the binaries I haven't been able to try out the example given at the page            $ build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug configs/example/se.py --cmd=eon00 --options="chair.control.cook 
            chair.camera chair.surfaces chair.cook.ppm ppm pixels_out.cook"                  Does it work? I really don't wish to use cpu2000.py since I want to run SMT and multicore SMT configurations in SE mode. 
3) For SMT and multicore SMT configurtions would the above example (considering that it works for 1 CPU 1 Thread) work by just replicating the workload as processes and assiging them to each thread per cpu? Just as the hello_world example?
4) For the configuration in 3) , does SIMPOINT/FastFwd work?I am trying to run this benchmarks as my last resort for my course project due this week (and also for further research) since other benchmarks such as ALPBench and PARSEC run fine in singlethreaded mode but, when trying to do multicore, SMT or both they abort and fail and I haven't been able to fix it yet. 
I am running out of time and I'd appreciate any help. ThanksJavier Texas A&M UniversityComputer Science and Engineering Department
