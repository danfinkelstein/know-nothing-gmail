The args are fine, you're just passing the arguments to m5 incorrectly. The command should be an array of strings (like argv) not one big string. So changing the cmd line to: cmd = ['FFT', '-p',  str(options.numcpus),  ' -m18']  should fix the problem.

Interesting... from what you're reporting, it sounds like the problem
is likely in the code that sets up the stack (argv, argc, and all that
good stuff).  That's in LiveProcess::argsInit() in sim/process.cc.  I
don't know what if anything has changed in there from b3 to b4
though... I don't recall touching it, but Gabe might have.
The next step would be to put a breakpoint in that function and see if
the argv array really does have the right number of entries, and that
the entries point to the arg strings.

A typo. In beta, the number of complex doubles reported is:  262144 Complex
Doubles, which is correct since it should be 2^18. (the -m18 switch passes
this value).
So it there some problem passing these values to the benchmarks (atleast in
SE mode in beta4?) HAs something is parameter passing changed between beta 3
and beta 4?

ok I looked at the output and I think what is happening only 1 processor
ie being assigned to the benchmark, ragardless of what value i put. But I
dont know why this is happening. I type:
./build/ALPHA_SE/m5.opt configs/splash2/runsplash.py -n 4 -k 4 -b FFT
and still at the end of simulation using beta 4, it reports this:
 1024 Complex Doubles
 1 Processors
 65536 Cache lines
 16 Byte line size
 4096 Bytes per page
if I use beta3, this is what is reported:
 1024 Complex Doubles
 4 Processors
 65536 Cache lines
 16 Byte line size
 4096 Bytes per page
the line in the config script that invokes fft is:
class FFT(LiveProcess):
  cwd = options.rootdir + '/kernels/fft'
  executable = options.rootdir + '/kernels/fft/FFT'
  cmd = 'FFT -p' + str(options.numcpus) + ' -m18'
If I do a print options.numcpus here, it correctly prints out "4". So n=4
is definitely being passed onto fft.
I dont know why in beta 4, the correct numcpus is not being used by fft,
or some other benchmarks.
Any ideas?
Thanks for your help.

I don't recall what the output files are called... each benchmark is a
little different in splash.  You're looking for the benchmark output
in addition to the m5 output... I'm guessing something bad happened
and the benchmark quit because it encountered an error.

The benchmarks ends because m5 reports "target called exit()".

Thanks, this is very interesting.  Have you looked at the output from
the benchmarks that are producing weird results?  I'd say from those
stats (and your comment that those benchmarks are finishing "extremely
fast") that the real problem is that the benchmark is terminating
early, before it even gets to forking off threads on the other CPUs,
due to some error.  Presumably the output is indicating what the
problem is if you look in the right place.
So there's still some problem with b4 if you weren't encountering that
error in b3, but it's not that the cache statistics are broken.
