 resuming it again?I don't see a command-line param for it, but you could roll your ownby setting up a loop in your simulation script where you callm5.simulate(interval) and then m5.stats.dump() and then repeat.  Youcan look in configs/common/Simulation.py to see something similar inthe code that dumps checkpoints at regular intervals.Steve>>  ________________________________> Get easy, one-click access to your favorites.
