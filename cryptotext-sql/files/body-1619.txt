I'll admit that it's odd that listen can fail in that instance, but my
guess is that it's some sort of race due to running multiple copies of
M5 and both of them trying to bind the same port.  That said, you
haven't posted enough information to debug the problem.  i.e. what's
the stack trace at the panic?  Another thing to do would be to add
strerror(errno) to the panic message.  In reality, it should work just
fine to return failure instead of invoking panic in that instance.
