I want to add some parameters to the DRAM object. Example, if I want toadd a 'energy' parameter (float) as an input to the DRAM, can I do thefollowing:Add lines:EnergyLP1 = Param.Float(1E-6,"Energy in Low Power State 1")
to the "DRAMMemory.py" and "PhysicalMemory.py" filesandEnergyLP1(p->EnergyLP1)to theDRAMMemory::DRAMMemory(Params *p)BEGIN_DECLARE_SIM_OBJECT_PARAMS(DRAMMemory)
BEGIN_INIT_SIM_OBJECT_PARAMS(DRAMMemory)CREATE_SIM_OBJECT(DRAMMemory)sections of the dram.cc fileDo I have to specify it in all these sections?Thanks,Sujay_______________________________________________
