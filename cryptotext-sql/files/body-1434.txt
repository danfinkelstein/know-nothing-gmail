Don't use init at all.  Use a kernel command line option
(boot_osflags) to change init to your own shell script.  Something
like "init=/m5/bin/init.sh". Thanks... I hadn't thought of bypassing /sbin/init entirely (nor would I have known the right incantation off the top of my head). 
Also, if we're going to create a new
tarball to share, I'd like to suggest that we work on getting my new
m5ops into the tree.  They extend /bin/m5 to have a readfile command
that takes a parameter, so you can read different files.  Those files
are just python objects, and the objects can actually be any python
file object, so you can wrap strings in your config file and such.
I can send you my patches if you'd like to check it out.I think this is a great goal, but I'd like to start with the more modest objective of just reproducing something that's functionally equivalent to the image we already distribute.
I do want this to happen though; I've recently run into bugs in the Intel network device model that I can't create a regression for because the kernel we use for our regressions doesn't have an Intel driver.

I actually stole my stuff from an install of gentoo, but that's not
strictly necessary.  The install helped because I was able to emerge a
few packages that aren't in the stage3 tarball.  I do believe that we
should be able to figure out a crosscompile solution for this.
Alternatively, I do have an alpha up at HP that's outside the firewall
that you can use.I think I recall Gabe saying that you can configure portage to use a cross-compiler.  I could probably figure that out, but given that I'm a total gentoo newbie I'd be happy to receive canned instructions.  Anyway even if we eventually end up just generating a new image that most people use, it would be good to document the process for those people that need something more custom.

I think we want to deprecate linux-dist and move everyone to gentoo.
I'm willing to help build a new image, but I don't want to do it
alone.  I've hesitated before, because I'd like to move *everything*
to the new image, tests, documentation, etc.
Yea, like I said, I'll start with the modest goal of just documenting the process as a side effect of getting something that's usable for me personally.  Generating a new image that's worth posting as a download is step 2.  Actually using that image for regressions etc. is step 3.
