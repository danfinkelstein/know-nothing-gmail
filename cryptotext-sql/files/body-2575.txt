You generally don't want to use printf itself, but the easiest thing
would probably still be to print something from your process function.
You'd want to use the DPRINTF family of functions for that. Usually
there is a traceflag that turns them on and off, but you can use
DPRINTFN to always print. The syntax is basically the same as printf.
