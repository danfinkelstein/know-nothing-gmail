Hi all,
I have two questions about the virtual memory implementation on M5
ALPHA SE mode.
(1) In M5, the virtual address is translated to the physical address
before the cache access. Now, I want to do the padding in my
application to control the data locality.  For example,  partition
several datasets to fit all of them into the L2 cache, and each
dataset is exactly mapped to its own sets in the cache. The
application can only see the virtual address, and the L1/L2 caches are
using physical address. Is it possible to do the padding to control
the spectral locality in application level?
(2) If I want to control the virtual to physically address mapping in
the page level, where is the entry point of the M5 source codes? And
how to do it?
Thanks a lot,
Meng-Ju
