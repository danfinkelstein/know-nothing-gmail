Just an example of why I think timingsnoop() is not only called on a  cache miss.
I simulate a system with multiple processors and no caches at all. timingsnoop() is still being called and also traces show readreq packets have destination of -1 (Broadcast). Thats why I asked is dest=Broadcast only on a cache miss !
Also, if I add 70 some processor cycles to account for the actual latency due to snooping and address arbitration logic on existing architectures, say Power5,the overall number of ticks become humoungous..alomsot an 80% increase :) but that maybe due to large number of read misses !
