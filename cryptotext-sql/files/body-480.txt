Hi,
I am interested in running m5 in the SPARC_FS mode for doing some
performance measurements for programs written with the Intel TBB
library. I've downloaded OpenSparc T1 which has a directory named
S10image. Can someone please help me in getting started with booting
solaris in the SPARC_FS mode? I couldn't find instructions regarding
the same on the wiki.
Regards,
Prasun
