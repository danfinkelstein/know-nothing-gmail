Hey all,
 
I was trying to modify the memory system to allow multiple
responses for interconnection modeling (in SE mode). However, it came to a “limit
reached” (running out of events).
 
The last packet that my interconnection dealt with is an
UpgradeReq, which doesn’t trigger any responses. However, I’m not
able to tell what it does. Can some one shed light on it?
 
Thanks!
 
Jiayuan
