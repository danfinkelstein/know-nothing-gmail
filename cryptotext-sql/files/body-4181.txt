You could add a constant vector without too much trouble. If you end up doing it, please send us a diff and we'll include it in the next release.Thanks,Ali- Show quoted text -On Mar 6, 2007, at 5:21 PM, Vilas Sridharan wrote:Hi Ali,Thank you for pointing that out -- I hadn't seen that originally.  Of course, one of the things that I glossed over in my initial mail was that I actually was hoping to be able to create a constant Stats::Vector in the constructor.  The Stats::constant seems to understandably only support single values.  (I am essentially trying to compute a weighted sum using a Stats::Formula as the product of two Stats::Vectors.) I have come up with a workaround for my own purposes, but it's ugly (set the Stats::Vector values the first time the object is called).  I was hoping for a slightly more elegant way of doing it, but oh well :-).

I think you justneed to wrap your constant in Stats::constant(myconstant) like isdone with the txBandwidth formula.AliOn Mar 6, 2007, at 4:14 PM, Vilas Sridharan wrote: > Hello again -->> Using M5 2.0b2, I have created a class which I instantiate in> various CPU structures.  This class uses Stats::Formula objects to> calculate values for me at the end of simulation.  These values > involve per-structure parameters which are constant over simulation> but different between each structure.  I'm having trouble getting> these values into my Stats::Formula variables.  I may just be > overlooking something silly here...>> From what I can tell, it seems that all the Stats get re-> initialized sometime between the constructor call and the time> simulation starts.  (I've tried variously putting init code in the > constructor and in regStats(), after the Stats have been> registered, with the same results.)  Is there a way to declare a> 'constant' stat that doesn't get initialized like this at the > begining of execution?  For some reason, I can't seem to use the> value that I pass in directly in the Stats::Formula, either (the> website has a note to this effect.)>> Am I missing something? >> Thanks,>>    -Vilas> _______________________________________________> m5-users mailing list> m5-users@m5sim.org>  http://m5sim.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/m5-users_______________________________________________m5-users mailing listm5-users@m5sim.org http://m5sim.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/m5-users_______________________________________________m5-users mailing listm5-users@m5sim.orghttp://m5sim.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/m5-users _______________________________________________
