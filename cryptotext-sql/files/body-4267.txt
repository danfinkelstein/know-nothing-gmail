Hi there,
   I am running M5 2.0 beta3 in full system mode and I use the default linux-latest.img file.But I found the capacity is only 50MB which doesn't allow me to copy a large benchmark into it.Is there any other way I can scale the capacity of current image file?
  Thank you very much for your help.
                                                                                                    Yue
