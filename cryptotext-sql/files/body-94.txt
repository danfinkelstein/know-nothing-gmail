Hi,I am trying to figure out the following issue:When I run a "null" program (empty main function without anything), there are still more than 160 dcache misses, and more than 200 icache misses. Is that normal? Or where do they come from?
I am using SE mode with one core and the version is 1.1Thanks a lot,Qingyuan
