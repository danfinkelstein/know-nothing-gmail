I'd actually like to see it.  I think this was because of the version
of swig, not gcc.

It means that M5 can be compiled with gcc 4.3.  You should be able to
run anything that linux can run under FS mode.    Our disk image is
admittedly pretty old though.  We'd love to have someone step up and
get something newer out there.  I've personally been using gentoo
alpha for my disk images lately.

What happened?  I'm not sure when I'll be able to get a new crosstools
build out, but I think that there are others on the mailing list that
may have one available.  We'd be happy to have something newer on the
website.
Anyone want to volunteer to get a new disk image going and a new cross tools up?
