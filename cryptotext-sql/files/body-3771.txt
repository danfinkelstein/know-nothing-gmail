The correct way is the MAC address, and it's always the mac address. The IEEE 802.1D specification has a section on ethernet switches that describes the process.

Actually, the EtherLink model can be completely replaced

System1--EtherInt1-|-Interface1--Interface2-|-EtherInt2--System2

                         System3
The above box is the switch model. The peer of EtherInt(i) is
set to be Interface(i) and Interfaces in the box are
interconnected with Links instead of EtherLinks.
In your switch model, even though there are N EtherInts in
the box and they are connected via Etherlinks from/to
outside, some kind of route procedure is still needed.
When the packet arrive at the EtherInt in the switch model,
how can you determine which port is appropriate? I think
the only way is to find the destination information from
the packet,no matter mac address or ip address.
So the question is how to get the destination information
from packet.

Hello,
I have created an EtherSwitch model to replace the EtherLink.
However, I got two problems:
1) In original EtherLink model, each Interface has only one
 txlink, so when Interface::recvPacket(packet) is called by
 its peer, txlink->transmit(packet) is returned. But in
 the EtherSwitch model, each Interface has N-1 txlinks(N is
 # of systems), so function recvPacket(packet) must
 determine
 which txlink is needed to transmit the packet.
The idea is that each two endpoints should have an EtherInt. So each
system will have an EtherInt and then the switch should have a
separate EtherInt for each "port" that exists on the switch. The
probably should be connected with an EtherLink.
I tried to
 find the destination information in the packet. I looked
 through base/inet.hh and found the function dst() can
 return
 the destination address, so I wrote the following codes:
             IpPtr p = IpPtr(packet);
             uint32_t ip_address = p->dst();
 But the simulator exited with error when it ran the
 above codes. Can anyone know how to get the destination
 information from the packet?
You should read the IEEE 802.1D ethernet standard. Not all packets
transfered across ethernet are IP packets. You need to route based on
MAC addresses, not on IP addresses. The switch model needs to keep a
list of MAC addresses behind each port and then when it receives a
packet it needs to find the appropriate port and send the packet to
it. To be complete the model also needs to detect when no port exists
and respond appropriately.
2) similar to the above problem. In original EtherLink model,
 when Interface::isBusy() is called, it just returns
 txlink->busy() since it has only one txlink. But in the
 EtherSwitch model,  isBusy doesn't know which txlink
 is needed to transmit the packet and the worse is no packet
 can be used to determine the destination. One feasible
 solution is make sure all txlinks are free before a packet
 is transmitted although only one txlink is used. My
 question is how to modify the original code in order to
 replace isBusy() by isBusy(packet).
I think this will be more clear when you read the above specification,
but the architecture should look something like this:
