Hi Jiao,
That question is answered in a number of places on the website (www.m5sim.org). Please take a look at the FAQ, the Tutorial slides from ASPLOS, or the video from ASPLOS for an explanation.

Hello, everybody:
I am a student of Northeastern University and am trying to use M5 simulator for my research.
I run M5 in full system mode, with pre-compiled Linux OS. I am trying to load application on to M5 - I mean, run it on top of Linux OS. (The complete procedure is: write a simple C program, compile it into executable using cross compiler target to ALPHA processor, then load it onto the Linux OS which runs on M5).
I don't know how to load an executable onto M5 full system, is there any suggestion about that?
Thanks and your help is really appreciated!
Sincerely,
Jiao
