I'm trying to adapt the cache model to my interconnection module which 
duplicates packets. I came into "simulate() limit reached" when replacing the 
toL2bus with my interconnenction in splash2/run.py (SE mode). A further 
investigation show that this happens upon a Stq_c. 
 
Can you give some information about how M5 handles store-conditional/link 
load? I observe that the TimingSimpleCPU switched to DcacheWaitResponse while 
the L1 cache sends UpgradeReq requests, which, however, never gets any 
responses. Hence the cpu hangs there and ran out of events.
 
I noticed that some where in the cache the UpgradeReq is replaced by 
ReadExReq, but I can't figure out under what conditions. I'd appreciate any 
help.
 
Thanks!
