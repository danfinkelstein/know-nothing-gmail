I am extremely sorry for confusing you. I am using the same cache architecture for different simulations. It works for some simulations and gives problem to some others. In precise, It works for single thread per core simulations but gives problem with multi thread per core. (Note! I have used same block size for all the caches). 
 The error message is:.............................................................................................................
warn: Increasing stack size by one page.m5.opt: build/ALPHA_SE/mem/cache/cache_impl.hh:312: bool Cache<TagStore>::access(Packet*, typename TagStore::BlkType*&, int&, PacketList&) [with TagStore = LRU]: Assertion `blkSize == pkt->getSize()' failed.
Program aborted at cycle 2903472000.............................................................................................................Could you please suggest me any thing possible reasons to this problem.

No, you are not being very clear at all.  Be precise.  What *exactly*
are you changing?

This isn't clear.  What did you change?  Just the size of the cache?
Nothing about the block size?  Are you changing the block size at all
in the ones that are failing?  What are you changing in the runs that
are failing?

You have to give a better bug report if you want help.  Before you
sent us your configuration and all we saw was that you were changing
the block size so that it was not all the same for all caches.  THIS
IS NOT ALLOWED.  Other than that, we have no clue what exactly you're
doing.
I'm sorry, but we're getting very frustrated at your lack of a
detailed bug report.  Read this article about giving bug reports
before you try again:
