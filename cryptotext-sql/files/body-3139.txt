Hi, Lisa
 
I only need few stats to analyze the runtime characteristics of an application. For example the number of dcache.ReadReq_hits, icache.ReadReq_hits, etc. I added these codes  "Stats::StatEvent(true,false);" in function simulate(Tick num_cycles) located simulate.cc. But I didn't get the result I wanted. Could you tell me what is the correct way to get thest stats? Thank you very much!

doing this will result in millions of large files full of stat text - what is it that you want this for?

Hi,
 
I want to dump m5stats after per cycle. I've looked up the code. Maybe I can add some codes in function simulate(Tick num_cycles) located simulate.cc. Fox example, add a StatEvent like "Stats::StatEvent(true,false);" in this function? But I'm not sure how to do it correctly. I'm using m5sim 2.0b5 in SE model.  What is the correct way to get this information? Thanks!
