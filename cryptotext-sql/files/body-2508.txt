Could you post the command line you use to run the simulation?
I think there are two directions you can try.
(1) Write a "Hello World!!!" program, compile it, and see if M5 can
give you the right output.
(2) If the m5stats.txt is empty, there must have some things wrong. Do
you see any error message on screen?
