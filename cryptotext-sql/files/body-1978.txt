Thank you Eduardo, I have got the binaries onto the image. When I tried to run the program, I got an error:modprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No such file or directory
modprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No such file or directorybash: ./OCEAN: cannot execute binary fileIt seems that the precompiled linux lacks some file. But I have no idea how to deal with this. I have found someone proposed such a problem before, but no answer followed.
I downloaded the splash from the wiki of M5, and the file format is COFF for alpha.How can I add that file to the precompiled linux ?
Hello,
Regarding the question of how to run your own benchmarks in FS, it is
not necessary that you create a new disk image. You can use the one
that is provided in the wiki, in this link you can download one
http://www.m5sim.org/dist/current/m5_system_2.0b3.tar.bz2
What you need to do is add your own programs in the disk image
(linux-latest.img), to see how to do it read this question in the FAQ,
How do I add files to a disk image?. And after to run your program in
FS you need to create the rcS file change the directory for the image
in SysPath.py, and I think that?s all.
I do not why you say that the SE mode is not suitable for what you
want, you can run any program in SE mode, the thing that I do not
quiet sure know is if you can is run multithread programs in SE, I saw
some patches to do that, but in theory as M5 is provided you cannot.
I hope it helps.
