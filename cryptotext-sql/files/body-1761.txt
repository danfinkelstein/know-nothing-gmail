Where were you trying to execute this code?  In M5 or in the guest?
It certainly won't work in M5.  In the guest, it will only work in the
kernel.  Those directly mapped addresses aren't legal in user code.
If you need to read/write to physical addresses in guest user code,
it's going to take a lot more work and you're going to need to learn
more about how to do that in linux.
