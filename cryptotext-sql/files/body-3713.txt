I forot to mention he clusters on either side of bridge have a single physical memory. So essentially there is no communication on the bridge. The purpose is that if the two clusters are running independent two-threaed applications,then coherence and snooping overheads are assumed to be that resulting from two cores rather than four cores.

>Thanks Steve for the reply. Infact, I dont want coherence across the bus bridge. It is assumed that clusters either side of bridge are running independent applcations. So, I want coherence to work accurately on the pair of two cores rather than across all four cores. This will work right?
