There is no contention modeling at all within the current cache model,
either for subbanks or for the cache as a whole.  It's up to the thing
connected to the cache (the CPU or bus) to model contention and limit
the number of requests per cycle to match the number of logical ports.
 Nothing has changed in this regard between b3 and b4.
Not that we wouldn't be glad to have someone add that and contribute it back!
