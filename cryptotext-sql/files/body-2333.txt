Source numbers have nothing to do with nodes in the global network. As you can see in bus.hh:83, the BusPort that receives the packet rewrites the source id stored in the packet to that of the BusPort. You can only determine which BusPorts correspond to cores if you know for sure the order in which things were connected, as Steve stated.If you are using something like the example fs.py script, and you have enabled the L2 caches, then I believe port 0 will be the L2 cache itself, while all higher number ports will be processors. If you enable the L1 caches, then there are separate instruction and data caches and each one should have its own port, so it is not actually the case that each core will have a single port representing it on the bus. If you leave them off, then the port numbers 1 through np should correspond to the core number. If you don't have the L2 cache, then the numbering is more complicated (check in common/FSConfig.py if you want to figure that out).Someone correct me if my estimate is wrong. I've not used the example scripts in quite a while, and I don't think I have ever done any bus debugging using those scripts.	- Clint- Show quoted text -On Nov 5, 2008, at 3:09 PM, Bob Nagel wrote:Hi Steve thanks for your answer, how can I know the src number of the cores?, I have been trying to identify them by the access but I only see dfierent src number accesing to the bus without a clear pattern, do you know where is the source code in which is assigned the src number to the cores?. Thank you. 2008/11/5 Steve Reinhardt <stever@gmail.com> The bus IDs are essentially arbitrary... they're assigned by the bus as devices are connected to it, which happens in an uncontrolled fashion as the simulation objects are created.  Note that the each object attached to the bus gets its own ID as well, so for example if you have split I and D caches then each of those caches will have its own ID.
