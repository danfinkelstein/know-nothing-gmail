Hi all,
I have a L2 cache problem in the M5 1.1 SE mode. When I run 2
different programs on 2 different cpus, I find that these 2 programs
access the same address. For example, program A accesses it's data and
read the address 0x01e5f2. Later, program B accesses it's data and
read the same address 0x01e5f2, too.
I dumped the req->paddr in the cache module, and It seems that the
memory references of program A and program B are overlapped. This will
make the L2 miss of program B become a L2 hit.
Maybe I misunderstand the m5 cache model. If I am not, is there any
easy way to separate the memory references of multi-programs in L2
cache? Then the measurement will be more accurate in the M5 SE mode.
Thanks,
Meng-Ju
