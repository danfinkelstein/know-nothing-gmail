There is a patch from Jiayuan Meng to let the M5 SE  mode can run the
multithreaded program.

You can port it to the M5-2.0b6 very easily. You can also find a
Splash2 p-thread version from the Internet. Then you just change the
p-threads functions with the M5 system-call emulation functions  in
the M4 macros.  That's how I run the Splash2 in the M5 SE mode.
