Dear Rick,
I am just curious, even if a thread is assigned to a core we will not be able to
use multi-threaded application in SE mode unless we use the patch by Jiayuan
Meng and translate our benchmarks to use his thread version rather than
pthreads. (Please correct me if I am wrong)
regards,
Isuru
