Hi Stijn,
Obviously we would be very happy to have a parallel version of M5. If we can do anything to help, please let us know. Most of the code in M5 is owned by some university (Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida State, Edinburgh, etc), so it generally is possible, however in some cases it can be a lengthy process.
Thanks,
Ali
