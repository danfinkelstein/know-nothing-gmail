Hi,Any solution or bugs were fixed for this 32 bit machine issue???I wanted again to use m5, or I may try to find a 64 bit machine to make it work out?

Hi all,
I'm having the following problems getting m5 working as it is before any
modifications, and hope if anyone can help...
1-It was correctly built for ALPHA_FS & SE & SPARC_SE, but has the following
error when trying to buld for X86:
g++ -o build/X86_SE/arch/x86/decoder.do -c -Wno-deprecated -pipe

2-When trying to execute regression tests they report failure on all the
built simulators (ALPHA_FS & SE and SPARC_SE), I get the following:

The thing I've noticed, but don't know whether it has something to do with
this problem is:
".hg directory not found " message
checking the m5-users archive, this is related to "M5 style hook", which is
probably related to Mercurial, which is not something critical I guess.
I'm using OpenSUSE11 and installed the most recent stable versions of
python, SCons, SWIG, zlib and m4.
Anyone who can help me out??

The x86 failure was already talked about, and I think Nate is right about it being a 32 bit vs. 64 bit issue. It's hard to tell for sure for the "FAILED" regressions, but if you look in the output files in the directories that are named, I'm betting you'll find something about a file not being found. The actual binaries and I think input files the regressions depend on aren't distributed with M5 for legal reasons and to keep the size of the repository reasonable as I understand it, so they'll basically all fail except the various "Hello world!" ones.
