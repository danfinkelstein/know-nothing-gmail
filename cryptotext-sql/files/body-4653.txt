Hi,
The link on M5 page for v1.1 points to the linux-dist for v2.0
Would that still be compatible for v 1.1? And is there any specific version of cross-compilers for v1.1 or linux kernel for v1.1?
I am not sure if this is compatible. Unless you have a particularly strong reason to do so, I would try to use v2.0 because the support will be better.- Show quoted text -
Thanks,
