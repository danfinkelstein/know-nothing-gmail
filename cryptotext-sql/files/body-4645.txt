Hi,
Has anyone run the ALPBenchmarks on M5 System Emulator mode?
I have built the statically linked binaries for ALPBench using a cross compiler.
First I got the error of: 'unimplemented system call' (_systcl: which i changed to ignore system call).
then I get the error : fatal: Syscall 427 out of range
I also had another fundamental question, if in my run.py script for the SE mode, I specify 4 CPUs, and my application has 4 threads, then it would schedule a thread on each of the CPUs,right?
Also, can anyone tell me the significance of the code in the encumbered directory?
Thanks,
Meeta
