With the bus model, all the devices are probed atomically to determine who
the responder will be in regards to the coherence model. First all the
devices that need to be snooped will be probed first(in you're the L2's),
the responder then sets a flag on the pkt called memInhibit (the L2 that
will supply the Owned/Modified line to the load miss). When the L3 is probed
by the bus, it sees the memInhibit flag is set and returns without doing the
access, so this is how the L3 is informed a cache to cache transfer is being
done. Hope this helps.

Subject: [m5-users] Snooping / Simultaneous Lookups in multiple Levels
Suppose I have multiple L2 caches connected via shared bus and a single
shared L3. Also a load miss in one of L2s is served by another L2
(cache-to-cache transfer). How/when is the L3 informed regarding  the
cache-to-cache transfer? Is it accessed simultaneously and later inhibited
after some time?
