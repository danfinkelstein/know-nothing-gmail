I'm not sure where the syntax error would be coming from.  Are you getting an ImportError?  You need to add the util/pbs directory to your PYTHONPATH environment.
For example:
blue% env PYTHONPATH=pbs ./profile-top
Usage: ./profile-top [-1bc] [-g <dir> ] [-n <num>] <jobs directory>
    -1        puts each file on one line (default no)
    -c        groups symbols into categories
    -b        dumps data for bar charts
    -g <d>    draw graphs and send output to <d>
    -n <n>    selects number of top symbols to print (default 5)
Otherwise, if this isn't your problem, I'd like to see the actual error output.

I'm using M5_1.1. I wonder how to get information from the m5prof.* files
using the profile python script. I ran the /util/profile-top file with the
m5prof.* filename as the argument, such like:
%: profile-top m5prof.client.full0
However, I got 'syntax error' when the first line of the m5prof file is
read. The python version is 2.4. I would like to know how can I figure this
out.
Thanks,
Yu
