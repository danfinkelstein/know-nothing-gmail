You should be able to switch from two simple cpus into an smt o3 core, although I don't think it's been done for a little while.  That isn't scheduling per-say, so I'm not 100% sure I've answered your question.
I still think the general problem is that if you have to some how restore individual checkpoints which each have the same memory layout. The easiest way I can see to get around this is to start the physical memory allocation for each benchmark at a different place (although you might have to have the same benchmark at a variety of places so you could make any collection you wanted). The next think you would need is some way to make the page table support different thread ids/address space identifiers/etc.

Hi,
Is there any good method of scheduling a thread between CPUs? I am trying open two threads from a checkpoint and put them into a SMT processor. What would be the best way to proceed. I could imagine scheduling them from a single core to a SMT core, or just finding a way to schedule them together at the beginning. Any ideas?
