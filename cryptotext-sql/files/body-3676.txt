Hi all,
 
I am trying to run some simple benchmarks on M5 using CMP architecture. My question is how can i run my benchmark parallel i.e. if i have 2 processors how do i schedule the instructions for each one? 
 
Do i have to configure my system, for example on se.py file , and define the workload to each processor or do i have to make the scheduling within the benchmark, for example using pthreads?
 
I want to simulate MIPS architecture on SE mode
 
Thanks
