I would like to know how to use m5's MySQL functionality, which I believe
allows me to write simulation results into a MySQL database.
I wasn't able to find sufficient infos on this neither on the Wiki nor in the
Mailinglist - other than I need to compile in MySQL support, which I believe
I have done. But how do I tell m5 to dump the stats into the MySQL db? Where
do I specify host, database, user, password?
You need to add the following to your scripts:
import m5.stats
m5.stats.initMySql(......)
Look at src/python/m5/stats.py to see the parameter list.
To create the database, use the util/stats/stats.py script.
That script will also retreive the data.
Unfortunately, this feature of M5 was pretty much only used by me.  I haven't done a large study using it in a while, so it may have suffered a bit of bit-rot, but I'm willing to help you fix it if it has.  I do hope to clean up and fix things some day.
