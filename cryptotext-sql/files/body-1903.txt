Hi,
I have compiled the SPECcpu2000 v1.2 natively on an Alpha machine
running Linux. All C benchmarks seem to be executing without any problem
in m5 SE mode. However, when I try to execute any fortran benchmark, I
get an error like the one below:
M5 compiled Feb 16 2009 19:27:08
M5 revision 5591:be93223fd0c3c8faabbd337db9e5e576c8905397
M5 commit date Mon Dec 15 18:10:21 2008 +0100

Aborted
I am using the "ref" inputs for all benchmarks.
I have compiled the benchmarks using the script provided with the v1.2
distribution adding only the -static flag.
Am I missing something?
Thanks in advance,
Nikolas
