I'm certain that this isn't an M5 problem since I've been using that
call a lot.  2.6.13 is probably a bit outdated.  I've been using
2.6.18 lately and it works there.  The port to more recent versions is
pretty easy.  Ali, aren't the patches available somewhere?  If not, we
can put them all up on the website.

Hi,
I am running a multithreaded application with regular
linux pthreads.
I want to bind a single thread to a single simulated
processor. For this purpose i am using
sched_setaffinity system call in side the common
function executed by all threads.
But while executing the program the sched_setaffinity
is failing and i get "Function Not implemented"
message.
I am using m5 beta 4 and default version for kernel
(2.6.13).
If the kernel version is not proper for this feature
then is there any other recent version available which
has support for processor affinity system call for
alpha?
Any help will be highly appreciated.
