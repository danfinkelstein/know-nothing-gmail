That error comes from the simulator itself. It means that you are
asking M5 to allocate a region of virtual memory larger than your OS
supports. The primary cause of this is running on a 32-bit OS, any 64-
bit OS should have a (practically) unlimited amount of virtual memory.
You can try modifying the configuration to use less memory for that
workload, but if the memory capacity has been overloaded for that
workload, it most likely means that it is unable to run with any
smaller size of memory.
Others may have comments specific to that workload.
