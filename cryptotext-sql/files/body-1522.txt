Hi,This question is probably really simple, and I have read documentation repeatedly, but the semantics are just confusing me.So,We have 3 types of processors: O3,Simple, and Atomic.We then have three types of memory systems Timing, Atomic, Functional.
In the M5 command line  using the default python scripts (fs.py) when you type -d --caches -l2cache  you will get a O3 processor with a timing memory system.When you use -t  you will get a Simple cpu with a functional memory system.
When you fast foward you get Atomic memory and processor.Is this correct? Or did I totally get it wrong?Thanks,
