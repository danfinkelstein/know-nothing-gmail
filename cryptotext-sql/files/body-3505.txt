Hey Dan,
it was my understanding that if someone else has a SPEC license that
then you can exchange binaries, but if they dont then you can't.
Ali is probably the best resource on licensing stuff.
I'll ask him about it tomorrow and see what we can come up with. Maybe
we will be able to just link to your page from the WIKI?
