Rick is correct.  Kevin Lim started it, but never finished it.  If
someone wanted to try to finish it up, that'd be great.
The idea of the ozone CPU was to create a CPU model that was an out of
order analog to the simple cpu model.  Adding out of order allows this
model to get an MLP greater than 1.  The difference between O3 and
Ozone is that O3 has the goal of being realistic and highly
configurable.  Ozone would be somewhat configurable, but the goal is
for it to be fast.  This sort of model would allow you to roughly
approximate a modern core without paying hugely in simulation time.
