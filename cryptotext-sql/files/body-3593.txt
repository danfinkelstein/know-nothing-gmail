All the caches and memories use a standard "port" connection...
fundamentally you'd just have to write a 2D mesh model that uses the
same port model and drop it in in place of the bus.  The hard part is
that the coherence protocol assumes a bus, so you'd have to modify the
protocol (really develop a new protocol) to work on the mesh instead.
That's non-trivial.

Sure.

Other people have done this, but it's not in the standard
distribution.  If there's anyone around who's willing to share what
they've got, please speak up.
