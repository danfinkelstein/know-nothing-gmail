I'm pretty sure I've responded to this did you not investigate?
Look in /proc/meminfo
If "MemFree + SwapFree" is not greater than the number you've put in
that physmem times the number of physical memory objects you have plus
a couple hundred megabytes for M5 itself, you don't have enough
virtual memory to do what you need.  Add some swap space.
