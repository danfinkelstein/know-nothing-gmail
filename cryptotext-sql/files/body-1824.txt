Are you concerned that the total number of accesses is small, or just that there are few concurrent accesses?  If it's the former, I'm stumped too, and I wold suggest turning on some tracing (e.g., start with --trace-flags=Cache) and you can see what's going on during the simulation.
If it's the latter, I think the reason is that you're using TimingSimpleCPU which models a blocking pipeline, so you're not going to have more than one outstanding access from each CPU at any point in time.  Thus it's not surprising that you rarely see more than two total.  If you want non-blocking behavior from the CPUs you'll need to use the O3 CPU model.

Hello all,
I am testing PARSEC benchmarks in FS along with DRAMSim and I get very
few accesses to the memory. Normally I do not have more than 2
petitions waiting to be processed. If I increase the latency of the
memory I still get very few accesses, and the size of the caches I am
using is really small. I consider that this is a problem of my
configuration of the simulator. In my rcS I am trying to execute 4
benchmarks at the same time using the & operator, I have something
like this:
...250k.dat 220 &
...rret/output.txt &
...mate/out.fluid &
...eal/1000.nets
/sbin/m5 exit
The execution of the benchmarks is right all of them finish
successfully. But I do not know if all of them are running at the same
time.
I do not know if using & will work in M5, if this is not the right way
to execute the 4 benchs at the same time. Can anyone please provide a
way to do this in FS?.
Also regarding the few accesses and my configuration, this are some of
the main parameters I have in the FS.py:
L2Cache(size = '8kB', assoc = 4, latency = '7.5ns', block_size = 64,
mshrs = 64 )
SplitL1Caches(L1Cache(size = '4kB', assoc = 2, latency = '0.5ns',
block_size = 64, mshrs = 64 ),
                      L1Cache(size = '4kB', assoc = 2, latency =
'0.5ns', block_size = 64, mshrs = 64 ))
As you can see those cache are really small. And I think I should get
much more petitions waiting to be processed in DRAMsim. I have tried
different benchmarks but in none of them I get a big amount of
accesses. Does anyone know what am I missing in the configuration?.
Thanks a lot in advance.
And finally if someone need this is my config.ini file:
