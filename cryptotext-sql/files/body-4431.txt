The tutorial's out of date... it was true at the time, but not any more.  If you check out the wiki page:
http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Compiling_M5
you'll see that we now require gcc 3.4 or newer.  (It's
hard enough to keep it working with the new gcc releases, at some point
you have to give up on the older ones.)Steve- Show quoted text -On 7/13/07, Dean Michael Ancajas <dbancajas@gmail.com

Note: I was able to produce some neat outputs, I only posted below the error messages,please let me know if you want all of the output messages. I dont really know the true cause of the error but it seems that my C compiler doesn't recognize the declarations. My gcc version 
3.2.3 and it should work fine according to the tutorial documentation.===========================start here================In file included from build/ALPHA_SE/base/bigint.cc:31:build/ALPHA_SE/base/bigint.hh:39: 'uint64_t' is used as a type, but is not
