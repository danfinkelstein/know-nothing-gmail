Hi Yue,
There are several ways to do this:
1. You can get the blank image script from the Download page, create a new blank image that is the desired size and then mount both images and copy the contents of the 50MB one to your new one.
2. You can use the 50MB image to boot the system but then mount a second disk image that has your benchmark on it by adding the image to FSConfig.py and then mounting it with an rcS script
3. You can build an entirely new image of the desired size with PTX dist (also available from the Download page).

Hi there,
   I am running M5 2.0 beta3 in full system mode and I use the default linux-latest.img file.But I found the capacity is only 50MB which doesn't allow me to copy a large benchmark into it.Is there any other way I can scale the capacity of current image file?
  Thank you very much for your help.
