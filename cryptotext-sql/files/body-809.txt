Dear Soumyaroop,
You are right, I should've provide you more detailed information.
-I am indeed using the ALPHA_SE configuration, with the "m5.opt" binary.
-For now I am not using a standardized benchmark but a small
self-generated program.
-The trace flags I am using are: "InOrderExecute", "InOrderStage",
"InOrderStall", "InOrderCachePort" and "InOrderExecute".
Thanks,
Maximilien
