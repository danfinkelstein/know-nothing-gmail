The number is 9223372036854775807. Would tracing the memory system be the way to go to figure out the problem?

Is the some number a really really large number? 9223372036854775807? If so then I would think the o3 model is waiting for an event that never happens (probably a request to memory that isn't returned). If it's some other number or random numbers I would guess that there is something wrong with the run xxx instructions code and the o3 cpu.

Hi all,
A number of the spec2000 benchmarks have a problem during the resumption of a checkpoint. The problem is that the checkpoint resumes fine in O3CPU model (the checkpoint was made in AtomicSimpleCPU model), but it only simulates a fraction of the interval that it was supposed to. M5 spits out the message "Exiting  @ cycle <some number> because simulate() limit reached." However, if I resume the benchmarks in the AtomicSimpleCPU model, then they work.
It seems like the cpu O3 model is getting stalled and the simulation tick fastforwards to its limit. If I resume simulation in AtomicSimpleCPU then all is well.  Any ideas of what is going on? If you want an example, take a checkpoint of ammp at 59*100E6 instructions (or at curTick=2,981,099,451,500) and resume that checkpoint to run for 100E6 instructions. The simulation will end after 248,483 instructions have been simulated.
This seems to be the last big issue in getting everything working for spec2000 checkpoints. Any help is appreciated ... ^_^.
