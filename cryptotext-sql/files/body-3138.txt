I want to dump m5stats after per cycle. I've looked up the code. Maybe I can add some codes in function simulate(Tick num_cycles) located simulate.cc. Fox example, add a StatEvent like "Stats::StatEvent(true,false);" in this function? But I'm not sure how to do it correctly. I'm using m5sim 2.0b5 in SE model.  What is the correct way to get this information? Thanks!
