Our research group is evaluating M5 as a possible new simulator standard.  Some key information I have not been able to find anywhere, so your help is greatly appreciated:
(1) Full system simulation on SPARC:  The Docs imply this is available, but the tutorial implies you still can only do a full system simulation on an Alpha.  Can I get hardware acceleration out of a SPARC machine?
You can do single processor full-system simulation on SPARC and boot Solaris.  In theory multi-processors should work -- the code is written -- but it hasn't been tested/debugged. If you're interested in doing it we have some infrastructure to do cycle checking Legion (Sun's functional simulator) that we can share. There is currently no support for native execution on SPARCs.
(2) Simulation speed.  I need a sense of both the software and hardware performance in instructions/second.  This is a critical piece of information and I have not found it anywhere in the docs or tutorial.  I would even accept anecdotal information about M5 speed.
We get about 2M IPS on a simple CPU model. Full-system isn't supported on our out-of-order model, but it would be a good bit slower.
