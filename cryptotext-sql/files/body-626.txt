Hello,
For my research I am working with the in-order CPU core of M5. I'm
working in system emulation mode for Alpha: ALPHA_SE. The version of M5
is 2.0.
I have a problem concerning the adjustment of the latency of
multiply-operations.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I adjusted the latency of the multiply-operations to 3, to get a more
realistic execution. This schedules a multiply operation at the correct
Tick (namely 1500 Ticks later). The problem is that the execution of the
multiply-instruction takes as long as if the latency was still set to 1.
This means that the instruction doesn't stall in any of the stages.
Since the Write-Back stage happens (just after but) at the same Tick as
the multiply-event there is no inconsistency.
I've debugged a little bit more to clarify the problem. I set the
latency to 4. The multiply-event happens one tick after the write-back
stage, but the instruction could still call the graduation unit even
without the execution of the multiply-event!
I think the bug is in cpu/inorder/resources/mult_div_unit.cc
When MultDivUnit::execute gets called it schedules the Event for
multiplication at the desired Tick. After this it calls
mult_div_req->setCompleted().
This makes the instruction proceed through all pipeline stages without
stalling.
I can provide you some more details. The call stack is
MultDivUnit::execute
Resource::scheduleExecution
Resource::request
ResourcePool::request
PipelineStage::processInstSchedule
PipelineStage::processInsts
The MultDivUnit gets called when the instruction is in stage 1. It gets
called a second time in stage 2. I don't know why the latter happens:
another event gets scheduled 1 tick later then the first one.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What should I modify to the code so that it will work correctly? do I
need to remove "setCompleted"? Where do I place it?
Thanks and kind regards,
