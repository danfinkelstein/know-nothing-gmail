I'd just like to make a comment to M5 users in general.  If you're
working on something that is beneficial to the community as a whole,
you get some benefit by putting up the effort to get it committed to
the mainstream tree.
1) You don't have to merge anymore, it's in the tree
2) More people can look for bugs
3) New changes are less likely to break what you're working on since
everyone will be compiling and using your code.
4) Once I fix the regression system to make it easier to add tests,
your code can automatically be tested by us by our regression system.
  Nate
