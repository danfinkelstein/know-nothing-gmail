According to the OpenVMS chapter of the Alpha Manual, IPL 31 is machine check errors, which is baffling. I am curious to why their "seems" to be so many of these IPL changes to this level. It doesnt sound right if IPL 31 correspond to machine check errors, I am wondering if this is incorrect. And exploring that their is a possible cross compiler bug.- Show quoted text -

IPL 31 is the highest IPL level. Any time the kernel enters a critical
section it switches to IPL 31 so it is un-interruptible.
