Hello I have a quesiton regarding a simulation of more htan 4 cores in FS,
In the FAQ it says that is is possible, and to do that you go to the
download page and download some patches. My question is that in the
downlad page those patches says that are only for obsolete versions
and I am using the latest M5 version. So my question is: should I use
those patches?, or since they are for the obsolote version they are
not going to work in the new one.
Thank you.
