Hi Jun,There are some subtlties when using non-statistics variables in a formula. Please read http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Using_the_Statistics_PackageregStats is probably getting called (you could put a DPRINTF() there to make sure), but either way your formula is incorrect.Ali- Show quoted text -On Oct 3, 2007, at 5:20 AM, Jun Pang wrote:- Show quoted text -Hi all, I want to print some statistics of physical memory in the m5stats.txt file. Following the example in dram.cc and dram.hh, I first add " virtual void regStats();" function as a public member and " Stats::Formula bandwidth;" as a protected member of MemoryPort class where I want to get the statistics. The body of regStats() in physical.cc file is as follows: void PhysicalMemory::MemoryPort::regStats(){         using namespace Stats;        bandwidth        .name(name()+".bandwidth")        .desc("bandwidth of memory")        ;        bandwidth = data_bus_cycle*5000/curTick; //data_bus_cycle is a variable defined by myself          } However,  there is no bandwidth information in the m5stats.txt. I think maybe the function regStats is never called but I do not know how to call it, or is there anything wrong with what I have done? Could anybody help me?  Thank you very much! Jun Pang _______________________________________________m5-users mailing listm5-users@m5sim.orghttp://m5sim.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/m5-users _______________________________________________
