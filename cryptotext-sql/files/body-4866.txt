I am still having problems inserting DPRINTF in coherence_protocol.cc
printf works though, but I need to also get the cycle number and processor number to analyze the printed trace, which comes naturally with DPRINTF
Does any one know how to do that?
What exactly is your problem?  In order to use dprintf, you need to compile either debug or opt (not fast), and turn on some trace flags. running m5 with --help should give you some info.  The debugging page on the documentation section of the wiki has a bit more info.
