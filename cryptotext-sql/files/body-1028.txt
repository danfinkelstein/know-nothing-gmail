Hi, everyone,I am starting to use the M5 simulator to implement some research idea. Right now, I come across a problem with initializing the full system simulation, which can be described as follows:(1) I installed the required system files under the directory "/dist/m5/system", which contains two sub-directories "binaries" and "disk";(2) I launched the command "./build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt   configs/example/fs.py", and the shell shows the following information:some preceding information**** REAL SIMULATION ****info: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...(3) then, the simulation stayed still and doesn't proceed to show any further information. According to the introduction of the M5 full system mode at the link http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Running_M5_in_Full-System_Mode, I expected to see the root filesystem "/" but I didn't see such kind of a thing.Did I miss any steps when doing so? What should I do if I want to get the shell of the simulated OS like what I can in Simics. Any help would be greatly appreciated!Thanks,Leonard_______________________________________________
