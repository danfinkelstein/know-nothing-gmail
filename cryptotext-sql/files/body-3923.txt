Just to be clear: ticks are just ticks, the smallest discrete unit of
time.  They aren't processor cycles.  It may just so happen that your
processor cycle time is 1 tick, but that's not a given.  Particularly
in FS mode we use 1 tick == 1ps, and we've been trying to move there
in SE mode too.
The 'clock' field in the bus object is the number of ticks in a bus
clock.  You should not be adding values that are not a multiple of
clock to tickNextIdle, as then the bus may start processing events at
times that are not bus clock edges... this won't necessarily break
things but it doesn't make sense from a timing perspective.
I don't see any reason why your code change would lead to negative
numbers; you should run under gdb to figure that kind of thing out.

But if I insert processor cycles e.g., tickNextIdle+=78, the traces are not in accordance with what is expected and even the total numebr of cycles are less than without adding extra cycles. I am looking for the right way to insert processor cycles (ticks rather than numCycles) for a certain packet?

At one point after first 4000 cycles, the tickNextIdle gets calculated to a negative number, which the following trace on bus shows: Please suggest whats the right way to add busCycles. If I add processor cycles (tickNextIdle+=100), I dont have negative numbers but the traces show results not expected !
