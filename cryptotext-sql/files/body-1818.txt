    Hi all, I searched deep into the source code to find out the whole execution path of a memory instruction in o3 cpu model. It actually divides into two parts  initiateAcc and completeAcc, the latter is call by the recvTiming().  
    In the same file of initiateAcc, there is a function execute() that combines the two function initiateAcc and completeAcc. I wander why the M5 wants to execute an instruction by two functions not by one , making the execution path kind of confused? 
    Further, I found that the uncached access must be executed only when it reachs the head of Load/Store queue. Why the uncached access cannot be treated like cached access? and when it actually reaches the head, does M5 perform the access through sendTiming and recvTiming, I seemed to not find any code in these two functions that distinguishes cached and uncached access. Thanks !
