Hi All,
I am running into problem using stats in M5. I had previously added a
few scalar stats to the M5 code, which worked fine for me, as I got
the corresponding data in m5stats.txt. However, today I added some
more, but could not get it to work. The code compiles well, but I get
a runtime error with the following panic message:
panic: stat check failed for
 @ cycle 0
[check:build/ALPHA_SE/base/statistics.cc, line 244]
I suspect it is reading a "blank"/non existing stat variable, for
which the check is failing, but am not sure. Any ideas into what might
be happening?
Thanks in advance,
-Gaurav
