Thank you very much .... i will check this.- Show quoted text -On Wed, May 13, 2009 at 6:54 AM, Steve Reinhardt <stever@gmail.com> wrote:
My guess is that it's much simpler... if all of those benchmarks work when you run them individually, then you're probably running out of memory (very likely when you try to run that many spec06 benchmarks together) and one of them isn't checking the return value from malloc().

The way I would debug it is quite involved since there are many
threads running simultaneously. You need to figure out which CPU and
which thread is causing the error...
***Assuming your benchmarks already work on an AtomicSimpleCPU ***,
First thing I would do is run GDB on simulation B, then backtrace to
the frame that has "faults.cc". In that frame, you can query the CPU
and hopefully the thread that caused the fault through a member
function of the fault class. Or maybe, you can backtrace some more to
the CPU code that calls the fault function and you can query that
information there. Somewhere a "p this->cpuId()" in GDB would do the
trick. The ThreadContext can be queried to figure out which thread.
Once you figure out the CPU, I would then get traces of your
benchmarks in AtomicCPU without the ticks (so you can compare). Run
each sim individually with a traceflag like "Exec,-ExecTicks". I'm not
sure which flag removes the thread number but you can find that in
src/cpu/SConscript for the cpu trace flags.
Next, get execution traces from your O3CPU simulation run and separate
the the tracedata for each benchmark.
Finally, you can diff the SMT (O3) individual traces with the Atomic
individual traces to figure out where the first bad instruction is
(which will lead you to the problem).
Yea, I know that's quite involved but since the error message is so
bland, I dont know what the quick fix would be.
