Hi everyone,I am new to M5 and trying to use it as a simulator for StreamIt applications (in syscall emulation mode). StreamIt compiler generates C++ and then g++ for x86 is used to compile the output to machine instructions. Since it seems that Alpha is the most stable ISA in M5, I am going to install g++ for Alpha and use that for compiling C++ code generated by the StreamIt compiler. My question is about installation of Alpha cross compiler. Can I just install the latest version? or I need to use a specific version?
Thanks,Amir
