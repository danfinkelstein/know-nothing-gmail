We'll try to post a more complete page on the wiki (http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/SPEC2000_benchmarks) on this topic soon, but hopefully this is enough to get you started. We run several of the cpu2000 benchmarks for our regression tests and although we don't ship around the reference outputs you can get a lot of information from how those tests run. The configs/common/cpu2000.py makes creating cpu2000 workloads a good bit easier. The first thing that you would have to change is the spec_dist path at the top of the file to where ever you have your binaries and input sets. We have our binaries and input sets organized in the following directory structure:cpu2000/binaries/ARCH/OPSYS/BENCHMARKcpu2000/data/BENCHMARK/INPUTSET/FILESwhere ARCH is alpha or sparc, OPSYS is linux or tru64, BENCHMARKis the name of the spec binary (e.g gzip), INPUTSET is the input files (e.g. smred), and FILES are the specific input files. If you can't create this structure you'll have to mess with cpu2000.py to change how it finds files.The cpu2000.py configuration file takes this data and creates an m5 workload parameter based on benchmark name, isa, operating system, and input set. If you take a look at tests/long/00.gzip/test.py you can see an example of this, but in brief:from cpu2000 import gzip_logworkload = gzip_log('alpha', 'tru64', 'smred')root.system.cpu.workload = workload.makeLiveProcess()Assuming you have a machine configured normally above that blob would correctly run the gzip log spec2000 benchmark for alpha/tru64 with the smred input set.Hope this helps,Ali- Show quoted text - On Jun 18, 2007, at 1:27 PM, viswanath krishnamurthy wrote:Hi all,I am Viswanath Krishanmurthy from Iowa State univ. Can anyone please tell me as to how to run SPEC2000 benchmarks ( alpha binaries) on the M5 simulator?..I already have the alpha binaries with me. But I am not familiar as to how to run these benchmarks on the M5 simulator.Thanks,RegardsViswanath KrishnamurthyWhat kind of emailer are you?
