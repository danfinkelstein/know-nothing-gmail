You can't use SE mode to access the disk image.  You will have to boot
in full system mode.  That said, it has been quite a long time since
anyone has booted Tru64 in full system mode.  It may or may not work.
Though, if it doesn't, my guess is that it's not too far off.
I'm afraid that you're not likely to get too much help with your
problem because your use case is outside the scope of the M5 project.
Who knows.  Maybe someone would be willing to help you for a fee.  Or
you could just buy a cheap alpha on ebay.  If you are truly interested
in getting Tru64 back up and running and you're willing to put the
effort in and post patches, I'm sure you'll find help here.
