There isn't a good Alpha JVM... the architecture basically faded away
before that happened.  But you don't really need/want one to run
Specweb; the java example code that comes with it is just that (an
example).  Real Specweb runs are always done with optimized C plugins
and not java.  See the SPEC web site.  We did this a long time ago,
but we used some code from IBM that we downloaded from the SPEC web
site.  (As part of the SPEC rules, companies have to provide the code
they used to generate their Specweb results if it's non-standard.)
