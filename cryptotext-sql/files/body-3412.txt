Hi,         I am trying to run spec cpu benchmarks on 4 core CMP system in se mode. I am using ALPHA_SE. When I  see the m5stats.txt file, it shows that only instructions were executed on cpu[2]. The number of instructions for other cpus were zero. Below is my configuration for the CPU and benchmarks I assigned for each cpu. Could you please help me to figure about why instruction is not executed in other cpu. Also, I am using EioProcess. Configuration for the system is as follows:process1 = EioProcess()process1.file = "/speccpu2000/perlbmk/perlbmk.eio.gz"process2 = EioProcess()process2.file = "/speccpu2000/gap/gap.eio.gz"process3 = EioProcess()process3.file = "speccpu2000/vortex/vortex.eio.gz"process4 = EioProcess()process4.file = "/speccpu2000/twolf/twolf.eio.gz"system = System(cpu = [CPUClass(cpu_id=i) for i in xrange(np)],                physmem = PhysicalMemory(range=AddrRange("512MB")),                membus = Bus(), mem_mode = test_mem_mode)for i in xrange(np):   system.cpu[i].max_insts_all_threads= 100000000 system.cpu[0].workload = process1system.cpu[1].workload = process2system.cpu[2].workload = process3system.cpu[3].workload = process4      I am looking forward for your kind help.ThanksBipin KadelHow well do you know your celebrity gossip?
