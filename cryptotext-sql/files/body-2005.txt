Hi All,
I am new to the M5. I am wondering if there are any algorithm people
using M5 for application level performance evaluation. I am working on
application level schedulers on multicore processor. In order to
understand the scalability of the scheduler, I intend to execute our
Pthreads code on a virtual processor simulated by M5, where we can
assign the number of cores in the processor (saying, 32 or 64).  I am
wondering if the above idea is feasible on M5 and if it is possible to
accurately  measure the execution time when various number of cores
(concurrent threads) are used in the simulated processor. Any comments
are highly appreciated.
Best,
Yinglong.
