At the encouragement of Nate, I have formed a list of possible
contributions that I could make to the M5 community. Like many of you,
time is against me so if any of these features sounds interesting to the
community, please let me know and give me a relative order of interest.
If none of the additions seem interesting, I will not be hurt as that
means more development time ... ^_^.
*Possible M5 Contributions*
    * Parsec Simulation
          o shell script for running various workloads
          o tips in compiling parsec for alpha while using the general
            parsec build manager
          o Observed difficulties with the different input sets and
            solutions
          o Performance numbers to compare against
    * Directory Coherence Model -- based on a upgraded version Jiayuan
      Meng's work
          o MSI directory coherence model
          o Supports packet piggy backing for invalidate, fetch,
            writeback requests
          o Banked model exists -- Based on Jiayuan Meng's work
          o Verified to work in both the memory tester and Parsec
            benchmarks for simsmall and medium
    * Mesh Model --based on Jiayuan Meng's work
    * Crossbar model
          o Full connected network plugin that is a minor rewrite of the
            current bus model.
    * Memory Debugger
          o Timeout for each memory access
          o Each memory access read is verified against a value stored
            in atomic memory blog.
          o Each memory write is recorded in the atomic memory blog
          o Inserts at the cpu_side of each L1 cache.
          o A separate memory debugger is plugged into IObus and each
            cpu core.
          o All memory debuggers connect to the same memory blog:
          o Memory blog uses the default PhysicalMemory object already in M5
    * New alpha console
          o I have not had a large block of time to figure out how to
            remake all the regression values.
    * Memory check pointing works for 2GB and greater
    * McPAT power model support
          o New power model replacement for Wattch that offers greater
            fidelity and completeness to actual systems.
          o You can use output statistics to generate power numbers
          o I have a script that generates a structured xml file with
            the combined information of config.ini and m5stats.txt that
            contains performance counter information and system settings.
I am probably forgetting a few things here, but I think this includes
most of the interesting changes that I could release. Let me know your
thoughts.
Thanks in advance,
Richard
