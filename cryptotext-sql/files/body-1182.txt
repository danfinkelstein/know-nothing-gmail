Hi,I am running a multi core multi-thread program on M5 under ALPHA-SE mode in SPEC CPU 2006. I can not get context id when tried to trace the parameters of packet. Is core id is context id or not? If not, how can we get the context id?
The next problem is that when I dump the content of the block in packet, in some tick times it has no data value in it.
Is it possible having no value in some tick values? if not, what can be the error for this?
The last problem is when i use isInstFetch() to distinguish the content of packet as whether it is data or instruction, it always return 0 value. So, i can't distinguish whether the fetch content is data or instruction.
Could anyone please provide me hints to figure out these problems.
Thanks in advance,devraj
