Hi all,
 
I have added a new CPU model into M5, derived from 
TimingSimpleCPU. When compiling on a 64bit machine, everything is successful. 
However, when I tried to compile it on a 32bit machine, my cpu model is not 
compiled (no files named "my_cpu_exec.cc" are created in 
build/ALPHA_SE/arch/alpha. 
 
Can you give me any hints?
 
Thanks!
 
Jiayuan
