Hello,
     I want to generate memory 
traces and associate them with the thread ID or process ID. Is there a way to do 
this? I am running m5 in FS mode and want to differentiate the memory accesses 
of a particular process from those of others, including the OS. I looked into 
the "Thread" and "ExecThread" traceflags but they dont help.
 
Thanks,
Sujay
