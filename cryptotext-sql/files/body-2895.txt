This is interesting; thanks for doing the experiment.  I think there
are at least two things going on here:
1. The times reported are obtained using the CLOCK() macro, which
calls times(), which returns the elapsed time in "ticks".  Clearly
Linux and SE mode have very different ideas of how big a "tick" is.
It would be easy to tweak SE mode to return something more in line
with Linux.  Note that in both cases TRACKTIME is about half of
COMPUTETIME, and PARTITIONTIME and RESTTIME are negligible, so the
TREEBUILDTIME/FORCECALCTIME ratio is the only major inconsistency.
2. The synchronization primitives in SE mode are done in M5 directly
rather than using ldl/stc, so synchronization is more efficient (but
less realistic) than in FS mode, and the processors don't issue loads
of instructions spinning on locks etc.  I'm sure that's where most of
the difference in instruction counts comes from (the rest would be due
to the instructions executed on syscalls, which of course are also
magic in SE mode, and in other OS overheads).  I don't know if that
explains the huge difference in the TREEBUILDTIME/FORCECALCTIME ratio
or not.  It'd be interesting to go back to the original SPLASH-2 paper
and see if it says anything about what the expected fraction of time
in each of those phases is.  Or just run it native on a quad-core
machine and see what you get.
