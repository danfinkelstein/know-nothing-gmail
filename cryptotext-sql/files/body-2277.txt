You are right that i386 programs won't work right now. There isn't anything
fundamental about that, but I have to focus my efforts somewhere and that just
hasn't been where yet. There are a few things that need to be set up
differently for 32 bit programs in how certain system resources are
initialized, but the main problem would be that 32 bit support is likely
incomplete and virtually untested. This will definitely work eventually, but my
attention is on getting the Linux kernel up in full system. If you'd like to try
to get it to work yourself, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have.
