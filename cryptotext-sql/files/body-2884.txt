   To just check the endianness and fail out if it's wrong, that should be a few lines in the loader to check a constant or two in the ELF header. To make it work, you would probably need to put an endian flip in the predecoder. You could either make the predecoder check whether the flip should be applied for every instruction, or put in a different predecoder in each case. The first could perform poorly but would be the easiest.

Good catch and points, Gabe...
How easy is that to implement?
