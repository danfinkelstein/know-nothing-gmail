Hi,Lisa.I am very appreciate of  your help, I have got to a normal prompt when running M5 in full system mode. I should have read the document carefully enough. Thank you ! The MAKEDEV still doesn't work, I found a MAKEDEV under /sbin on my platform, and copied it to the directory of M5 to replace the original MAKEDEV that supplied by the M5, but the same error came up again. I guessed the error maybe result from the compile process of the image, but I am not sure of that. I will still try to find out the problem, and maybe I will compile it again if necessary.
I'm not sure what's up with the MAKEDEV script, it obviously used to work
but it has been a long time.  Actually, now that I think about it, it
probably has to do with your platform, I bet the MAKEDEV shipped with
ptx-dist doesn't work with your platform, and if you typed "which MAKEDEV"
on your machine you'd find a local MAKEDEV that would work.
However, I'm not sure there was anything wrong with what you saw earlier. If
you were just running plain old fs.py, then it wasn't stalled, it was just
behaving normally.  fs.py with no arguments just boots linux and does
nothing after that, but continues to just...run.  it will go until you kill
it.
if you use the m5term utility, you can see the output from the boot process
and note that it will boot, get to a prompt, and just wait for input from
there.
