Well, the remote debugger just sits there listening on port 7000 which
anyone could probe.  You can turn it off by calling
m5.debug.setRemoteGDBPort(0) at the top of your script.  You could
also call m5.disableAllListeners() to disable all ports including the
terminal ports.  (Generally a good idea if you're not debugging.)
