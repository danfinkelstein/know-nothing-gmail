i had this happen to me when i was dumping atomic && timing checkpoints into the same directory, and specifying checkpoint 1 - but it would read the wrong one and give me that exact error because it was reading the first checkpoint (an atomic checkpoint) rather than the first timing checkpoint.  if you're doing the same, you'll want to separate them.

I'm trying to dump out a checkpoint of multi-core
system using Full System to allow me to run a profile of the binaries I'm
running in M5. I dump the checkpoint using the m5 pseudo instruction from
inside the application.  The checkpoint though seems malformed.  If I
dump it out running with timing simple cpu, the checkpoint will not load, the
simulator crashes with a fatal error saying it cannot read _status for
system.cpuXX.  I've tried making checkpoints using the atomic CPU,
and they seem load fine, but immediately after starting to run once the
checkpoint is loaded, the binary crashes with a kernel page handling error,
perhaps due to the fact it does not save any ITB entries.  Is there
something I am forgetting?
