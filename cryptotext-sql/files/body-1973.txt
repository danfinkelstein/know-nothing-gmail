Hi Isuru,
  I have checked these two links you gave me. However, the m5
multi-thread patch only support using its own APIs ("The
multi-threaded programs have to be coded with M5 thread APIs (included
in the patch"). It means that I need to rewrite SpecOMP to execute
them in m5-multithread. This costs a lot of effort. I will try other
easier approaches first. However, if all other approaches do not work,
I will try to rewrite SpecOMP by the M5 thread APIs.
regards,
  sitos
