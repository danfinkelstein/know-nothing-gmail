This is just for creating new threads on a different O3CPU. I am using
the script in configs/splash2/run.py, but when --detailed is used we run
into the problem that O3CPU thread context is initially allocated as
Suspended. If you try to add a hack that allocates O3CPU thread context
as Unallocated, you run into the problem that no available resource can
be found for a new thread in function activateWhenReady(...).  I guess
the hack to get around this to start everything as atomic or simple
timing and then switch. However, it seems that a slight modification to
O3ThreadContext<Implh>::activate could also solve the problem as long as
we check that no thread currently exists?
