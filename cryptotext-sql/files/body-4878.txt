Dear Ali,
Thank you very much for your help. I have done
whatever you mentioned in the previous mail.
When I saw the output in m5term, I came across the
following -
"SMP mode deactivated.
Brought up 1 CPUs
SMP: Total of 1 processors activated (4002.20
BogoMIPS)."
I would like to know how to specify/configure the no
of processors and the number of cores each processor
can have while performing the simulation.
For example, suppose, I would like to run my
multithreaded program in a single processor having 4
cores. The second situation is I have 2 processors
each having 4 cores. How can I configure these cases
during simulation?
Thanks for your time and help.
Regards-
Chaitali
