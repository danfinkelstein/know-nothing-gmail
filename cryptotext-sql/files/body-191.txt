Sorry, we can't provide SPEC binaries due to licensing issues.  If the
same binaries worked on an older version of m5 then stopped working
when you updated, though, then that's an m5 bug that we should fix.
Unfortunately the stack backtrace doesn't provide enough information
to figure out what went wrong.  It would be ideal if you could isolate
the mercurial revision where your binary stopped working.
The 'hg bisect' command offers a nice automated way to do that:

Or you can just do some quick tests of the revisions were
elf_object.cc got changed, and see if things worked on the parent of
one of these revisions and then stopped at that revision:
