Also, on some end, you can expect inorder to be slower than o3 because
o3 is naturally a faster CPU (architecturally).
O3 committing more instructions per cycle (8 by default for o3?) so if
you are comparing CPUs for the same amount of instructions that would
not necessarily be a good comparison if you are talking about raw
simulation performance.
Rather, if you are comparing raw performance you should compare how
long does it take each CPU to maybe complete the same amount of
cycles.
A good sanity check might be to look at the results from the
regression tests. In the "tests" directory, you can look at the
"stats.txt" file for each regression and you'll see the committed
values for simulation cycles and simulation time. Comparing those
across the CPU models should give you a good perspective.
