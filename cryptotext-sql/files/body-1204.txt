Thank you, Gabe.I figured out yesterday that the "config.ini" is written in the work directory during simulation. I have another question though. There has been at least one update in the stable branch since I had downloaded M5 last time. Is it advisable to generally upgrade to a stable release as soon as a new one is available?

You shouldn't make configuration changes in the config.ini file.
That's generated for historical reasons, I think, and because it's a
handy way to see what your configuration looks like. You'd want to
change things in your python configuration script. It looks like
there's a parameter on the O3CPU called numPhysIntRegs which should do
what you want.
