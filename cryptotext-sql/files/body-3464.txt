Hi Lu,
We currently don't support full-system ARM executables, even if the whole
program is statically linked. If you have the source for the program, you can
try to recompile it using the arm-9tdmi target of crosstools. If the source
program is portable C/C++, this should result in an executable that uses the
standard Linux system calls (which we are emulating with the ARM_SE target).
Note that you will still need to statically link when using this
cross-compiler. I am starting work on a full system (ARM_FS) version, but
there is a lot to do just to get things up and running for Linux support, let
alone stand-alone systems. We do plan on handling some of these in the future,
but it is hard to predict when it will be ready. If you have any questions
about getting ARM_SE to work right now, feel free to send email.
Thanks,
Steve
