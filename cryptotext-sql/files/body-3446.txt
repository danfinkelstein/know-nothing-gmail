That could be related to the cache changes I made to get writebacks to
allocate in the cache.  Looking at the assert, I'd say there's a 50/50
chance that the bug is simply that the assertion isn't valid anymore
rather than anything actually being broken.
Unfortunately I won't have time to look at it in detail for a few
days.  Can you try just commenting out the assertion and seeing if
those benchmarks complete successfully?
Thanks,
Steve
