python2.5... noError: can't find Python library python2.5[dean@moonfang m5-2.0b3]$I already have libpython2.5.so.1 and libpython2.5.so that is symbolically linked with the former(got the files from an RPM and extracted it with cpio). they are both in /usr/local/lib and /usr/lib/. i already ran the ldconfig command to both directories. my python 
2.5 installation is on /usr/bin. I installed it using source tarball with the default way of installing it(no addition configs) "./configure","make" and "make install" only.btw my setup is scientific linux 3(clone of redhat enterprise 3). my gcc version is "gcc version 
3.2.3 20030502 (Red Hat Linux 3.2.3-59)" and I already have the latest versions of SWIG and SCONS.I would really appreciate if anybody out there can help me. I have already looked into the mailing list archives and I wasn't able to find what I needed.Â  Thanks.
