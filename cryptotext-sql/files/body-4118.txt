Hi,
I have a nasty solution for integrating Wattch at the moment where
I am updating extern counters and calling watch update routines each
cycle.
I would like to move wattch to level of the m5 object, so one can get
the power of all the devices separately and get the result in the general
stats printout. The tricky part is that I need to be able to update a power stats
each cycle depending on whether the device is on or off (because they will either
have turned on or turned off values). What would be the best way of adding
a stat, that is Â updated at the end of every cycle?
I will also want to add voltage, frequency scaling. I believe that I can do this
by updating the voltage/frequency numbers in python/swig after breaking out
of simulation, and then jump back in after recomputing all the wattch power
parameters. Is there any reason why I might meet problems updating global wattch
parameters from swig? I have only done this on a small scale program, and it worked.
