Dear Isuru:
  Thank you for the useful link. I have build the patch and the
correspondent cross-compiler. However, I encounter several problems.
The goal of my work is to run SpecOMP on M5. For now, I tried several
approaches, and all of them do not work.
  1) I tried to use the newest M5 and the pre-compiled cross-compiler
from the M5's website. The cross-compiler can compile the SpecOMP
without error. But the compiled binaries can not run on neither
ALPHA_SE nor ALPHA_FS mode. In the ALPHA_SE mode, some threaded
related system calls are not emulated and the threaded application can
not be executed correctly. In the ALPHA_FS mode, full system
simulation allow the binaries run with the system call. However, I
always get Killed or Segmentation fault when I try to execute the
programs. I guess that is because the memory is not enough for the
SpecOMP benchmarks. The memory requirement of the SpecOMP is 2GB
memory for the medium benchmarking. However, I can not configure the
memory size to 2GB in ALPHA_FS mode. Therefore, I didn't run threaded
SpecOMP correctly for now. On the other hand, the non-threaded version
(compiled without -fopenmp flag) seems can be executed in ALPHA_SE
mode normally. Therefore, I think the compilation has no problem.
However, I have no idea about how to execute them.
  2) I tried to use the newest M5 and run the X86_SE or X86_FS mode
with the binaries compiled from conventional x86 gcc compiler. The
status is even worse....
  3) I tried to use the link you provide. However, there are several problems:
    (a) The modified cross-compiler in the M5 patch for multi-threaded
application seems only has C compiler without Fortran compiler.
However, most of the benchmarks in SpecOMP is written in Fortran.
    (b) When I want to use it to run the benchmark written in C in
SpecOMP, the cross-compiler does not support OpenMP. The gcc compilers
support OpenMP since gcc-4.2, and the cross-compiler is based on
gcc-4.1. The cross-compiler can not link the APIs of OpenMP correctly.
I have tried to search the source code of OpenMP library. Because I
think that I can compile the library of OpenMP by the cross-compiler
and link it to the SpecOMP applications. However, I didn't find any
one.
    (c) I tried to compile the application with the pre-compiled
cross-compiler from M5 website instead of that provided from the M5
multi-thread patch. Then, I execute the binaries in the multi-thread
M5 patch. However, the error message shows up to say that the M5
simulator can not support TLS mode (maybe thread level speculation),
and ask me to compile the binary with non-TLS toolchain. However, I
have no idea about how to build a non-TLS toolchain of gcc-4.2 which
supports OpenMP. (a non-TLS cross-compiler for gcc-4.1 is available,
e.g. the one from the multi-thread M5 patch)
  I don't know how can I achieve my goal. Can you give me some advise?
best regards,
  sitos
