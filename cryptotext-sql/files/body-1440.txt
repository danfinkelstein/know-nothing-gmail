/dist/m5/system is just a suggestion... you can put the files anywhere you want as long as you set M5_PATH appropriately.  Just put them somewhere that you have write permission.Steve- Show quoted text -

Hi,
I have downloaded M5 full-system files and set M5_PATH environment
variable. Now when I run "sudo mkdir -p /dist/m5/system" command, it
asks for my password and then report "my id is is not in the sudoers
file.  This incident will be reported."
How can I fix this problem?
Thanks,
Somayeh
