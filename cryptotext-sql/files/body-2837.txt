my script file *.py can run in the M5_1.1 , but it cannot run in M5_2.0b5. In my file, I implement cache by using BaseCache. The error is happened in BaseCache.
 
So, is there a big difference of BaseCache.py between these two different versions of M5?
 
How can I make my script file can run in M5_2.0b5? What change I need to do?
 
Thank you.
