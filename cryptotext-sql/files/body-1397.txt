Assuming that you are using alpha ISA, they have the steps mentioned in
the FAQ.  "BigTsunami support is included in the standard M5 Alpha
build, but booting with more than 4 CPUs requires modifications to the
PAL code and kernel as well. Take a look at the Download page for our
Linux patches and modified PAL code. Note that even with the BigTsunami
changes, simulatin". Here is the download page:

So you need need to download the latest patched linux kernel and make
sure M5 boots with that kernel. You also need to download the latest
palcode and make sure M5 uses that palcode. With that said, I have not
seen a successfull boot of more than 16 cores for linux 2.6.18, but
others have.
Best of luck,
