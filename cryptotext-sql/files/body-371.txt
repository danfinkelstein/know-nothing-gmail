I know Geoff Blake had worked on some TM stuff on an older version of
M5. It might be a good idea to check out some of the stuff he posted
on his webpage:

With regards to component testing, it might be worth configuring the
SimpleCPU model as a way to test different things. I know It's
probably not exactly 'component testing' in its purest sense, but it
may not be too difficult to get that model to execute some
instruction/memory trace that you want to use for small-scale testing.
Once you figure out where instructions interface to memory you can
edit the simulation at that point. I'm not sure about what you would
have to do if you want to isolate parts of the memory system though.
