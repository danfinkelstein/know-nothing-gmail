If you aren't interested in the prefetched see the most recent thread posted to the mailing list regarding how to run CPU2000 and that should handle your situation.You are correct, you can run the entire benchmark if you want to do validation.  Eventually if you want to do an architectural study where you very many parameters, you may think about doing a sampling technique (such as SimPoints or FastForward) to speed simulation time for each benchmark.
Let me know if you have any difficulties getting the SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks going according to the description.  There is going to be a Wiki page added to our website soon that outlines the procedure for doing SPEC CPU2000 both in SE and FS mode.  If you have questions before that please let us know via the list.

Hi Ron,I'm just looking to validate the simulation of the SPEC CPU 2000 benchmarks. I'm not sure why I'd need SimPoints or fastforward; I can run the complete suite in SE mode the (slow) normal way, right? That's what I've been doing.
With the same processor configuration, other than the prefetcher (which I wouldn't use), I want to make sure my clock cycles match yours.Thanks,Dan- Show quoted text -

1.1 with heavy modifications.  I have not ported the prefetcher design over to version 2.0b3 of the simulator.  I may still have the stats results for some of the benchmarks (GHB prefetcher) around if you would like to look at those. 
If on the other hand you are just looking to validate the SPEC CPU 2000 benchmarks and don't care about the prefetcher, you should be able to run those simulations yourself.  The results will depend on wether you use SimPoints, or the fastforward technique for simulation and you should match that with your own simulation. 
If you clarify exactly what you are looking for I can see if I can help supply you with the needed data to validate your simulations.-RonOn 6/20/07,

 I'm looking to validate the SPEC CPU 2000 benchmarks with M5 2.0b3 against someone else's validated results, and it looks like there might be some in connection with the "Analysis of Hardware Prefetching Across Virtual Page Boundaries" paper. Though I'm not interested in the prefetching modification to the Alpha, it doesn't matter that it's been implemented as per the simulated system parameters in Table 1 (of the paper); I want to get some kind of reasonable apples-to-apples comparison of my own environment with one that's known to work. 
Essentially I'm looking for results from the Michigan team, but I'm happy to validate against another if someone has the results. I'd like to see two things, basically:
 The py file used for the simulation and the m5stats.txt output for each of the benchmarks (or other output files, if you changed the defaults).If you used an earlier version of the simulator, it might be interesting to see if the numbers change with a new validation run... 
Thanks,Dan
