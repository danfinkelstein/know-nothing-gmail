You should be able to use suspend() and activate() on the thread
contexts to make this work.  You'll have to add at least some of the
hooks to call those yourself though, e.g., by creating a new event
type.  There's also a quiesce pseudo-instruction in alpha that will
call suspend() if you can put that in your binary at the right place.
