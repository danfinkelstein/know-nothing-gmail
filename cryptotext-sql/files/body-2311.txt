Hi,
I am confused about the IO-Cache filter ranges. I see that we set it to:
        system.iocache.cpu_side_filter_ranges = [ AddrRange(0x8000000000,
                                                            Addr.max) ]
        system.iocache.mem_side_filter_ranges = [ AddrRange(0, Addr.max) ]
Assume that we have a mesh network  connected to the memside of L1
caches  and cpu-side of L2 cache and a bus connected to L2 memside,
physmem, and IOCache. How are uncacheable writes in the kernel supposed
to figure out the network path to the IOCache if the
iocache.cpu_side_filter_ranges removes all the IO mapped addresses? The
recvRangeChange(...) in the membus will not get any new devices on the
io/bus due to filtering. This in turn means that the mesh will not know
about these addresses and will not forward the relevant requests. How
does M5 deal with this scenario in general? Is there a default port that
should be used? An example that uses only bus would be helpful.
Best,
-Rick
