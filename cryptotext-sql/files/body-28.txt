No one is working on this that I know of.  The coherence block size
must be the same across all caches, but you could develop a
sub-blocked cache to use for larger block sizes.  Hard to know how
long this would take; it depends a lot on your coding skill and your
familiarity with the existing code.

The MSHRs do get used in timing mode, but since the CPU models you
mention only have at most one outstanding miss, you won't see more
than one of them active at a time in any private cache.

Yes.
