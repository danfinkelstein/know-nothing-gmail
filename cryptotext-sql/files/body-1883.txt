Hello,
Is it possible to somehow determine the program counter, thread ID
and/or cpu ID from a Packet or Request object? It seems that Request was
setup to be either contain this type of data or to contain only physical
memory location data (stripping this data before it reaches the memory
system). This information would be very useful for a memory controller
to implement quality of service scheduling similar to what is in POWER5.
It would also be nice to distinguish between page table lookups,
instruction fetches and load/store ops. I see that I can reimplement the
cache component to be able to pass along the data (or possibly assign a
priority and send only the priority of the request), but I'm hoping that
there's an easier way that doesn't need to change so much of M5. Any
help is appreciated.
Joe
