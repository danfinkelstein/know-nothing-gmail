Hi,
I want to know if M5 is a deterministic simulator?
Is M5 a single-threaded simulator, or if not, how it support deterministic
simulation (the same result every time running it)? For example, GEMS is
considered deterministic because it is a single-threaded simulator.
Is this related to how we implement event queue (one main one or some
parallel event queues)?
Thanks,
Somayeh
