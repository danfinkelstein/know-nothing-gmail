I think that the optimization is fine, but when you set the
"Broadcast" target on a packet and don't actually get a broadcast, I
think that's confusing.  For example, I was trying to use the bus for
something else and was surprised by this.  Furthermore, when I
implemented a network, it seemed strange to use "Broadcast" to mean,
hey network, figure out the destination for me, as opposed to, hey
network, make sure this packet gets to everyone.
