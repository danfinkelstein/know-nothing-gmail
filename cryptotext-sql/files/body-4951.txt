Generally it is safe to ignore these messages.  The instruction is specifying precise trap-on-underflow behavior, and M5 doesn't support that, so we print the warning for completeness.  In fact, however, it doesn't really matter what the trapping mode is unless the instruction actually underflows, and I have yet to run across a benchmark for which the instructions cause an underflow in normal operation.  So unless the output of your program is incorrect, you are OK to ignore this.

Hi, 
I run some benchmarks on M5 and got bunch of messages like "warn: cvttq/sum f0,f10: non-standard trapping mode not supported". I tried -mfp-trap-mode=n option when I compiled the benchmarks. Still has the same problem.
