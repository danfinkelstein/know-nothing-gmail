It's part of the implementation of the Alpha "store conditional" (SC)
instruction, used for synchronization.  It's returning true because in
this case the access is "satisfied" in the sense that the instruction
can complete.
If you have questions about how SC works, please look it up (e.g.,
it's covered in section 6.7 of the 3rd edition of H&P under
"synchronization").  If you have more questions about the code
specifically, please ask.
