They're all bundled in M5, yes.  If you want to know how to do it by cycle, see the config script usage message, e.g. m5.debug configs/example/[se|fs].py --help.
 
If you want to do it from within your rcS scripts (sounds like you are doing FS), see slides from ASPLOS http://www.m5sim.org/dist/tutorials/asplos_pres.pdf.  Just plop the m5 instruction where you want it in your rcS file and it will do it.

Do you have the scripts to generate this?

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by 'available' - you can generate your own checkpoints, certainly...But we don't provide checkpoints for any benchmarks, just the facility for generating them.

Hello,
  I am not sure if this has been answered before. Are there checkpoints available in M5 for workloads like web, apache?
