Hello Ali thanks for the answer.
Is there anyway to confirm that the software threads that are running
are the same than the number that I set up in the rcS file?. Also is
there any way to know what software thread is running the CPU in that
moment?. I am interested in see the switching between threads.
In addition can anyone explain the meaning of the parameter numThreads
that we can define in the CPUs?. Thanks a lot in advance!.
