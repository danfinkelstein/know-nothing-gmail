This is correct.
SMT hasnt been compiled, tested, or anything for FS mode.
In theory, it should work out the box but there is most definitely
glue code that usually can only be debugged by trial/error and maybe
comparison to a known working model (like SimpleCPU).
We're currently working on adding more rigorous regression testing for
SE mode SMT as well.
