Hello,
I am having problems with the PARSEC benchmarks, I am getting this
error running x264, bodytrack, canneal, swaptions in a 4 core system,
in Full System mode, with 4 threads and with the small workload.
warn: allocating bonus target for snoop
m5.opt: build/ALPHA_FS/mem/tport.cc:97: virtual bool
SimpleTimingPort::recvTiming(Packet*): Assertion `pkt->isResponse()'
failed.
Program aborted at cycle 1878100939500
Aborted
This is my script:
#!/bin/sh
/sbin/m5 checkpoint
/sbin/m5 switchcpu
/sbin/m5 dumpstats
/sbin/m5 resetstats
cd /parsec/install/bin
./x264 --quiet --qp 20 --partitions b8x8,i4x4 --bframes 3 --ref 5
--direct auto --b-pyramid --b-rdo --weightb --bime --mixed-refs
--no-fast-pskip --me umh --subme 7 --analyse b8x8,i4x4 --threads 4 -o
/parsec/install/inputs/x264/eledream.264
/parsec/install/inputs/x264/eledream_640x360_8.y4m
./bodytrack /parsec/install/inputs/bodytrack/sequenceB_1 4 1 1000 5 0 4
./canneal 4 10000 2000 /parsec/install/inputs/canneal/100000.nets
./swaptions -ns 16 -sm 5000 -nt 4
echo "Done :D"
/sbin/m5 exit
/sbin/m5 exit
Have anyone experienced the same problem?. Is this a problem of the
benchmarks or is a problem of the simulator?, when I am running my own
simple test in the simulator normally I do not have any problems.
And finally is thre anyone there that have tried to run several of the
benchmarks together in the same workload?.
Thanks in advance.
