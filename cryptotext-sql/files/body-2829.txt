Is there a way to insert a trigger(probably not max_insts since it will halt the entire simulation) in SMT O3 cpu such that a single thread will be paused/resumed after it has executed a certain number of instructions, while other threads continue to execute? Possibly dump the statistics ...Then resume the threads all together ..? I'm trying to find a work-around on warming up the caches(before recording detailed simulation) without resolving to(Sampling) using two Atomic CPUs and having to deal with the page table entries and memory address collision stuff..
thanks, Dean Michael Ancajas
