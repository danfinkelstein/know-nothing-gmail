Actually, I want the busports of shared bus to provide tport-like functionality. So, everytime there is a transaction from l2 cache(private) to l3 cache (shared), if i attempt to store the packet (say in a queue or just a packetptr associated with each busport) to send it through a set of buses by scheduling events (currently if u connect several buses together, recvTiming is called immediately on all of them) without toucing any of its fields, i have mshrdownstreampending problems. Its sortof confusing, while the packet is passing through the bus, caches from above keep checking markPending, inservice and downstreampending fields (mycache()->markInService etc).
