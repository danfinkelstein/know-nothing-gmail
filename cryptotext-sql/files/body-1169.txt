This is just an arithmetic instruction and should be rather easy to
implement.  Just look in the Alpha architecture reference manual and
implement the instruction.  Check out src/arch/alpha/isa/decoder.isa.
If you have questions, let me know.
PLEASE send us a diff if you do implement these instructions.
