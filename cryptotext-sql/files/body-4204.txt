Hi Tracy,the path in Syspath.py merely tells the path to a directory holding all disk images.  what you really want is to adjust the disk in Benchmarks.py so taht it points to the image you want, instead of linux-latest.img
 (located in the directory that syspath.py should point to).however, what you are doing won't work, a blank image with just the cpu2000 images on it is not a bootable disk. you will need to ADD your cpu2000 files to the 
linux-latest.img, which *is* a bootable disk.- Show quoted text -LisaOn 10/3/07, rlai@mtu.edu <
