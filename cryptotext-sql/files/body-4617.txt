Hi Gabe,
 Thanks for your reply. Actually I forgot to mention that I am using M5
ver 1.1 but the file m5/arch/alpha/isa_desc in ver1.1 is similar to the
file you mentioned. Correct me if I am wrong.Also I am new to M5 so I
dont know how to add a print statement in the above mentioned file. Can
you please give me any example?
 I found an instruction rpcc which gives the current clock tick. I tried
putting this instruction before the instruction for which I need the
clock tick(in the assembly code for my C program), but I was unable to
understand how it works. Can you help me with this?
Thanks again,
Prabhat
