Hi Eduardo,
Do you have the config.ini in the /tmp/output ? I use your command,
and it's fine in my M5. I have the correct outputs in the /tmp/output.
I think you can try:
(1) Remove the "-d /tmp/output" from command line. The M5 will write
the config.ini and m5stats.txt directly into your work directory.
(2) Do you have enough quota on your file system?
