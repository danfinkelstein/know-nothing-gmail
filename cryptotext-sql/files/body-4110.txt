        One important consideration here is if you want to run in syscall
emulation mode where you simulate only the program, or if you want to
use full system where you simulate a whole machine, OS and all. If you
want to use SE mode, at least to start, you can use the se.py example
configuration with the -c option. If you want to use FS mode, you need
to put the program you want to run on the disk image you're using and
then set up an rc script which runs your benchmark. The rc script can be
specified when you use the fs.py example configuration.
