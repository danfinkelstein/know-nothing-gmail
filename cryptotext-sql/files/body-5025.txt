Hi James,
 
The problem is that the detailed model is
not included in the models being compiled by default.  Normally we only compile the AtomicSimpleCPU and TimingSimpleCPU
models.  When compiling M5, try adding “CPU_MODELS=AtomicSimpleCPU,TimingSimpleCPU,O3CPU’ to the scons
command.
 
For example:
% scons build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug
CPU_MODELS=AtomicSimpleCPU,TimingSimpleCPU,O3CPU
 
That tells scons
which CPU models to compile.  Sorry about
the confusion, and I’ll add this to the FAQ.
 
Kevin

detailed mode configuration bug
- Show quoted text -
 
Hi all,
After downloading, compiling, and setting up m5 to run in the full system mode,
I tried to boot the simulator in the detailed mode with:
./m5.fast -d output/ configs/example/fs.py -d
and I get the following error:
M5 compiled Sep 1 2006 17:35:27
M5 started Tue Sep 5 14:08:08 2006
M5 executing on idealjames
command line: ./m5.fast -d output/ configs/example/fs.py -d
panic: Simulator object type 'DerivO3CPU' not found.
@ cycle 0
[createObject:build/ALPHA_FS/sim/builder.cc, line 121]
Program aborted at cycle 0
Aborted
Note that the system boots perfectly with the -t (for timing mode) or with no
argument (atomic mode). I found the Deriv03CPU class within the
src/python/m5/objects directory and attempted to setup symlinks to see if this
was simply a path error of some sort, but I have never used Python before and
didn't have much luck. I have also installed the latest patch for m5 beta 2.
I also posted this as a bug in the "Flyspray" bug tracker linked off
of the website (I noticed I was the first, is this up and running yet?).
Thanks
