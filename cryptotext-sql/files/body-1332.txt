Hi,
We tried debugging the issue related to FA caches:
We found out that we get the segmentation fault due to the following
line in cache_impl.hh file
"  if (pkt->isRead()) {
            // Segmentation fault here...
            std::memcpy(blk->data, pkt->getPtr<uint8_t>(), blkSize);
    }
"
I guess this is because of the different findVictim method
implementation in the fa_lru code.
However, we could not debug this issue completely, could you tell us
where to find the actual source of this error ?
Thanks,
Siddharth

The fully associative code is different from the normal cache code and
I don't think it's used much, so it's entirely possible that there's
some bit rot going on here.  Perhaps you can spend a little time
debugging it.  We can help figure it out.
