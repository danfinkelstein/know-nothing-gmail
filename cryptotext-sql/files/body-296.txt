Thanks for the reply. I have a follow up question. So, lets say I am only using one O3 core and If I want to run 2-threaded SMT that means I will have to provide as input for instance 2 FFT  benchmarks. And for 4-threaded SMT similarly I will have to provide as input 4 FFT benchmark. In this case how can I do the comparison as the benchmarks have changed, in size. So my question was can I just provide lets say 1 FFT benchmark as input and then try to run it with 2 threaded-SMT and then with 4 threaded-SMT configuration. And I think you are saying it is not possible.  
Unless your FFT has pthreads or some other multithreaded software that will spawn threads for you, then no, I dont see it as possible. But, I'll let someone else respond if they have additional thoughts.
