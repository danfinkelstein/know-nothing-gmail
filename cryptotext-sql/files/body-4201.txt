Hi All,
   In the answer to "How do I add files to a disk image?" on the FAQ
website, I found "what you should do to add new binaries to M5 is
modify linux-dist and place it in that build structure."
   Can anybody explain these for me in detail? I put my created .img file
into the "disks" directory which includes linux-latest.img &
linux-bigswap2.img. I set the disk path in Syspath.py. But when I
connect to the simulated console, I cannot find the new binaries. Did I
put the .img file in the wrong place?
Tracy
