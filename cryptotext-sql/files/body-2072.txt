Dear Ali,
Thanks a lot for the reply. Your reply helps a lot. I went through the codes
regarding to Cache, Bus n Bridge. Then I wrote a component to be inserted
between cache and core. And I was able to successfully execute a simple program
on a alpha architecture with my component plugged in. AT the moment it just
passes what ever it receives to the other port. Anyway your clarification helped
me lot in understanding the M5 concepts. Thanks again.
I think this is the best simulator I found. Great Work.
