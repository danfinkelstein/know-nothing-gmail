I am using M5 to do some simulation and I am stuck with the following
problem. I want to know what particular instruction is currently executed.
Is it possible to do this in M5:
e.g.,
ADD r1 r1 r3
SUB r3 r2 r1
...
...
SUB r1 r2 r3
...
...
ADD r4 r4 r3
...
...
Is it possible to know at which clock tick 'SUB r1 r2 r3' instruction is
executed my M5?
In other words, how can I find the code which actually executes the
instructions in the binary?
Thanks,
Prabhat
