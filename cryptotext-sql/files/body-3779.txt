Ali's switch model is kind of network bridge specified in
IEEE 802.1D with each port connected with a system(subnet).
It can automatically discover the mac address of destination
of the packet in some way. Yes, if Ali's model is implemented,
it should work for cluster. However, I don't need to totally
mimic the real world network. I just want N systems to
communicate with each other in some way. For this purpose, it is ok to have mac addresses fixed and get them known ahead by the switch model. That is why I want to know how M5 sets
the mac addresses.
My switch model is much like EtherLink model, the bandwidth
(rate) is a parameter used to create switch model, as it is
used in EtherLink. I feel my switch model is more easily
implemented.
