Thanks for the pointers, Nate. I found the problem after a while. It was
actually not in the simulator at all :-)  It seems that the gcc I'm
simulating actually closes stdin and stdout when it finishes. Since the
simulator doesn't check for this, it just gets passed on and so the
simulator loses these too. I've just added a quick check in the syscall
implementation to catch these cases and ignore them.
Cheers
Tim
