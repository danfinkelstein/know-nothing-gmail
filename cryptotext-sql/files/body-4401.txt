Sorry, I meant statitics package in M5. I was trying 
to follow unittest/stattest.cc.
 
I defiend a bunch of Stats::Scalar<> types, and 
used the following code to print out the stats at the end of the simulation (I 
inserted into the end of the main loop in sim/simulate.cc):
  Text 
out(cout);  out.descriptions = true;  out.compat = 
false;  out();
 
and at the end, a lot more bonus statistics are 
printed out. Is there any way to turn off the default stats and turn 
on only my own stats?
 
Thanks!

    Hi all,
     
    I am trying to use M5's stat utility. But when i try to 
    output the stats that I defined, i found a lot more stats than I 
    expected.
    is there anyway to allow the output just show some 
    particular stats?
     
    Thanks!
