At cycle 1001 they would have been executed and removed from the event queue.

I'm confused now, are we talking about parallel simulation, or the
existing queue?  Events are dispatched and removed from the queue.  It
is up to whatever code is executed to schedule new events.  I'll wait
for an answer to this before attempting to answer the questions below.
 (They're a bit confusing to me.)
