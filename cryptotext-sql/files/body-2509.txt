Hi Meng thanks for your answer I did my test with the example code that it's here /configs/example/se.py, and this is the command that I used to run the simulation:
 
$  build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug -d /tmp/output configs/example/se.py
And this is the output that I get:

The execution of the simulation seems fine and in /tmp/output M5 create a new text file called m5stats.txt but it's empty. Maybe there is a problem with the compilation, to compile the ALPHA_SE I used this command scons build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug. Any ideas?
Thanks again.- Show quoted text -

Could you post the command line you use to run the simulation?I think there are two directions you can try.
(1) Write a "Hello World!!!" program, compile it, and see if M5 cangive you the right output.(2) If the m5stats.txt is empty, there must have some things wrong. Doyou see any error message on screen?
