Yeah, we're really bad at cleanup.  My suggestion is that you add a
shutdown callback similar to how we have startup callbacks.  Then we
can put an explicit call to a shutdown system before the simulation
terminates.
check out src/sim/startup.(cc|hh), src/python/swig/core.i.  You'll
need to expose the shutdown core to the m5 python library.  probably
src/python/m5/core.py
 Let me know if this is unclear.
