Hi,
I am trying to run SPLASH2 benchmarks using the ALPHA_SE mode for M5 v1.1
I don't see statistics for all the threads even if Â I run with -ENP=4 and run it for max_insts_any_thread = 50000000. this is specially for CHolesky and FFT. I did get some statistics for radix/LU/Ocean
Do I need to run these benchmarks for longer?
Thanks,
Meeta
