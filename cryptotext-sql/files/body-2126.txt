The short answer is probably not in the very near term, but there is a lot of
work and progress in this direction so it will work at some level in the medium
term. X86 is a very complex ISA with with a substantial subset of features most
people don't need, use, or care about like virtual 8086 mode, and support for
those sorts of things will happen later if they're deemed worthwhile.
