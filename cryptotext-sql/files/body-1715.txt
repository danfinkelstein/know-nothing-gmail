Hi, Gabe, Thanks for you reply.  I still don't quite understand how to solve this.  I download the stage3 from the net and is supposed to be 
newest version. How can I upgrade the kernel because I use the stage3 on M5 not on real systems, I didn't even install gentoo, all I did is 
create an image and run M5 and I still not be able to boot the system normally so how to upgrade the kernel remain confusing to me.
 
Nate sent an example to the list, I feel that very helpful, I have tried that too but not successful on gentoo, which I have questioned in my last letter.  The /etc/inittab seems not allowed to replace, and the /etc/runlevel/boot or /etc/runlevel/default which is designated in inittab take too long to boot. Where should I place the init script ? Thanks very much ! - Show quoted text -
 
Most likely what's going on is that the image is put together expectingudev to populate /dev for you. Since the kernel you're using is
apparently too old, there's no /dev/hda1 to mount. Upgrading your kernelor creating a device node manually may fix the problem. Also, thisoutput looks like it's from the default init script. Recommended
practice is to use your own init script that skips things you don't needfor a simulation and gets right to your, for instance, SPEC benchmarks.Nate sent an example init script to the list a little while ago you can
refer to.GabeVeydan Wu wrote:> Hi, all, has anybody sucessully using a Gentoo stage3 as an image to> boot M5? I have tried many times, Every time I use it, the following> error comes up:
