Hey all,
 
By using the --trace-flags=Exec debug tool, I found that there 
is a race condition in the malloc function in my multithreaded program. 
However, when looking into the malloc.c in the glibc, it said it is a 
thread-safe version. I also noticed that in malloc/arena.c, it uses 
mutex_lock(), which seems to be a spinlock. This may still be problematic if 
several threads are accessing the lock simultaneously.
 
So, what kind of synchronization support does M5 have in SE 
mode? Does it have store-conditional or test-and-set instructions or I'll have 
to add one myself?
 
Thanks!
