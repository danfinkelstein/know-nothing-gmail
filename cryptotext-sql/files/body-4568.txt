Hi,
 
I’d like to get the information of memory traffic
for an application. However, when I use command –MemoryTrace.trace=<filename>,
there is no trace file dumped. For a single core processor and only one
application is running, the default thread is 0, isn’t it? So, I don’t
need to specify the parameter “MemoryTrace.thread”, which is 0 by
default. I wonder why the MemoryTrace doesn’t work. BTW: I’m using
M5_1.1.
 
Thanks,
Yu
