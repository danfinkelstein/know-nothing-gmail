Most of the .rcS files use the "m5 checkpoint" command to take a
checkpoint near or soon after the script starts running.  If you add
this to your .rcS script and then set max checkpoints to 1, the atomic
run will end right after the first checkpoint is dropped.
When you want to run from this checkpoint, internally you have to
restore the checkpoint to a simple cpu then switch over to the
detailed cpu, but I think if you specify both a checkpoint to restore
from and "--detailed" on the script command line this is handled
automatically by the scripts.
