Hi,
I have a multithreaded program and I am pinning the
threads to different CPUs explicitly by using the
function "sched_setaffinity" and the macros "CPU_ZERO"
and "CPU_SET" mentioned in the link
"http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-affinity.html"
I have compiled the code using the cross compiler with
the  option "-D_GNU_SOURCE". My compilation command
looks like -
"/opt/crosstool/gcc-3.4.3-glibc-2.3.5/alpha-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/alpha-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc
   multithread.c -o multithread -lpthread
-D_GNU_SOURCE"
Then I copied the compiled executable into the disk
image (Pre-compiled version) provided in the M5
webpage. But while running the executable on the m5
simulator in full system mode, I got the following
error msg -
"mounting filesystems...
EXT2-fs warning: maximal mount count reached, running
e2fsck is recommended
loading script...
/benchmarks/multithread/multithread: /lib/libc.so.6.1:
version `GLIBC_2.3.4' not found (required by
/benchmarks/multithread/multithread)"
I checked the /lib/ directory in the disk image and
found that libc.so.6.1 is pointing to version 2.3.2 of
glibc.
I am not sure how to sort out this error.
Any suggestions regarding this would be greatly
appreciated.
Regards-
Chaitali
