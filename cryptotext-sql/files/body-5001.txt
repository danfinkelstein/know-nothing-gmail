Hi,
 
I was having some problems setting up a configuration file for a CMP. Can someone perhaps share a CMP configuration file that has 2/3 levels of cache? Also if somebody has a configuration file that sets up a shared last level cache or can offer advice on how to go about doing that, I would greatly appreciate it. 
 
Thanks,
Shyam
