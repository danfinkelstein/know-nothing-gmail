Hello,
In real network environment, if a client want to send
a pointer value to the server, it has to copy and send
the data on that memory address(pointer) instead of the
address itself.
I am wondering how it works in M5 simulator. Does it work
like the real network environment? Or the client and server
"share the memory", so the client can just send the address
(pointer) itself?
Xin
