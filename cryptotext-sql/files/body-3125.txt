Thanks,  It works. I redownloaded it and mount it again according to FAQ.But, there is no linux kernel source files inside "linux-latest.img". Where to find out what scheduling algorithms that the disk image of m5 simulator is using to run the benchmarks ?thanksMike May 9  2008 > Date: Thu, 8 May 2008 20:04:46 -0400> From: gblack@eecs.umich.edu- Show quoted text -> To: m5-users@m5sim.org> Subject: Re: [m5-users] about m5term and linux kernel> > It looks like when you ran mke2fs you reformatted the image...> > I think there may be some confusion on how this is supposed to work. > Basically, there are several layers of stuff going on here.
