dear M5 team,
I would like to simulate SPEC CPU 2000 benchmark fixed number of instructions in m5-2.0b3 ALPHA_SE mode.
I fast-forward for 100M instructions and then simulate for 100M instructions.I saw this subject fast-forwarding instructions few times but I can't resolve this probrem.
Use switchCPU?Sampler?Could you tell me how to fast forward instructions.
Thanks a lot
