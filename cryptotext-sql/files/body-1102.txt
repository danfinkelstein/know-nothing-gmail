I believe that in this case, you're going to have to just edit that
file.  I've actually got code that removes that file as part of my
sweeping changes to scons and tests, but it's probably a few weeks
from being committed.  (Basically there's a CPUModel directive in
SCons now).
The header file itself will have a path relative to the EXTRA
directory that you provide.
So if you have EXTRAS=foo/bar
and you have a file called foo/bar/blah/baz.hh, you'll do
#include "blah/baz.hh"
