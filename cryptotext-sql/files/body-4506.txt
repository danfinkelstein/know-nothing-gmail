Hey all,
 
When I am trying to test the scalability of M5, I ran the splash2
FFT benchmark with 16 cores.  M5 will prints out 
 
fatal: Out of memory, please increase size of physical
memory.
 
and then stop the simulation. I don’t know how this could
happen since obviously FFT is not that data intensive.
My questions are:
 Do you have any clue about what
     happened?
 in SE mode, does M5 support
     page swapping?  If I have a 128M physical memory and I am running 16
     threads, each of them allocate more than 8M memory space in the process’s
     VIRTUAL address space, how does M5 handle this situation in SE mode?
 
Thanks!
 
Jiayuan
