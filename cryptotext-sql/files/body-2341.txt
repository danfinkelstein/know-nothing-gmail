Hello again,Ali you were right with getCpuNum now I can see the core that is trying to access, thank you so much, without your help guys my work will be much hardar, thank you.2008/11/5 Lisa Hsu <hsul@eecs.umich.edu>- Show quoted text -
the very latest and greatest m5 has been changed to contextId() as opposed to getCpuNum().Â  and there's a check now.

pkt->req->getCpuNum()/getThreadNum(). However, they will only work if
the request came from a CPU and not from an I/O device. We seem to be
lacking a cpuThreadValid() method, so you may want to add one to the
request and test it before you grab your data.
