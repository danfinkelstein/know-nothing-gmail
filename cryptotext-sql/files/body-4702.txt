hey Lisa,
Exactly, out of the box works.  In fact, I've been able to build disks that have python and OpenSSH as well (needed for my application).  But when I added env, it created a problem;  I worked backwards from there and discovered that adding only env (without python and OpenSSH) was problematic as well, so that's when I came to the list.  So you are saying that you can create a disk with this ptxconfig:
http://cs.ubc.ca/~penoff/ptxconfig.plus_env_only
after you change the  PTXCONF_IMAGE_HD_KERNEL_SRC?  If so, I guess it must be my crosstool...
I built  my crosstool with this dat file:
BINUTILS_DIR= binutils-2.15
GCC_DIR=gcc-3.4.3
GLIBC_DIR=glibc-2.3.5
LINUX_DIR=linux-2.6.13
LINUX_SANITIZED_HEADER_DIR=linux-libc-headers-2.6.12.0
GLIBCTHREADS_FILENAME=glibc-linuxthreads-2.3.5
What were the contents of your dat file?
Thanks for helping!

Brad,
I'm having a hard time replicating your error.  I feel like I've seen
something like this before, but it was a long time ago.  So, when you build
out of the box, it works?  And adding env makes it not work?  What version
of gcc did you compile your crosstool with, out of curiosity?

Greetings Ali,
When I mount the disk image, /sbin/init exists.
If you build an image on your system following the instructions from here:
http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Using_linux-dist_to_Create_Disk_Images_and_Kernels_for_M5
... if immediately after cloning (step #2) you add Shell & Console
Tools->BusyBox->Coreutils->env ONLY, then finish the instructions, can you
mount your disk on your setup?  I'm wondering if it's a BusyBox issue...
I've put a copy of my ptxconfig here:
http://cs.ubc.ca/~penoff/ptxconfig.plus_env_only
..but obviously you'll have to change your PTXCONF_IMAGE_HD_KERNEL_SRC
line.
Looking forward to getting to the bottom of this,
brad
