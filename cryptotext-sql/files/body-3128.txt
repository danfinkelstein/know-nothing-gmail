The exit system call is handled, so you can hack into the exitFunc()
function in src/sim/syscall_emul.cc if you want to do it in C++.  In
python, the simulate function returns an ExitEvent object.  Right now,
you can see that we generally call only getCause() on that object.
There is also a getCode() function that you can call to get the exit
code.  If the cause is "target called exit()" then the code is the
exit code passed to exit.
