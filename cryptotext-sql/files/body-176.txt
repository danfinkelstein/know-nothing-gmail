Hi all,
I'm running a 64-threads benchmark on M5 ALPHA_FS with 64 cores. But the stats result shows that only 32 cores are working (running the application). Is this a normal case?
When I run it with 4 cores and 16 cores, the assignment is quite evenly. So I was wondering why it doesn't work for 64 cores ... Any suggestion would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Jie
