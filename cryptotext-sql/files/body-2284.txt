You don't have enough virtual memory on your machine to support that
much simulated physical memory.  There are two causes:
1) You're on a 32-bit OS and you just don't have the virtual address
space available.  There's nothing you can do here.
2) You don't have enough RAM + SWAP to cover the amount of physical
memory you want to support.  You can add a swap partition or file and
that will solve your problem.
