How can I tell how many of the kernel mode ticks are being used to handle the pthreads management and how much is being spent in kernel mode idle loop?  Is that what the two percentages are to the immediate right of the number of ticks in the output file?  What are these percentages if not?  
Thanks!Aaron

I don't know all the ins and outs of how stats are accumulated
(they're not always counting what you think they are), but do realize
that in FS mode cores that aren't running user code are in the kernel
idle loop (just like on a real machine).  So total ticks should
normally be consistent across all the cores since the cores don't
magically vanish and reappear based on whether they have something to
do.  (Though there may be differences if you're simulating from boot
and the OS actually enables the extra cores later in the boot
process.)
As for 2 vs 4 cores, that's more mysterious, but if your benchmark is
too small then you could be getting eaten up by overheads.
