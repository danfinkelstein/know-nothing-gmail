Since you want to run the programs on particular CPUs, you might want to use SE
mode where there is no scheduler and you can statically assign processes
yourself. If you really want to use FS mode, you're going to need to get Linux
(or maybe some other OS) to do what you want somehow. Looking at the resources
Shoaib recommended is a good idea since it will get you started figuring things
out.
