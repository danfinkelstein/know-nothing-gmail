Hi Meng-Ju,
You could define it in base/statistics.hh, however I'm not sure what
it would mean. I could see it working for a scalar statistics, but not
for any other type of statistic. Generally, statistics are  only for
book-keeping or printing at the end of an interesting bit of
simulation. I don't know exactly what you want, but numInst is the
number of instructions that have been executed. Assuming that your cpu
hasn't gone quiesced you can just divide the curTick by the cpu clock
rate.  If you really do want cycles it's probably safest to add your
own variable and duplicate the recording of that information in the
statistic.
