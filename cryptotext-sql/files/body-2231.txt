If you install Linux into a virtual machine (Bochs, VirtualPC, VMWare, etc.), you will have root privilege and will be able to mount the disk image within the virtual machine to make changes (albeit using sudo mount ...). I move the disk images around using scp, which performs file transfers through a SSH session. If you have SSH access to the server that M5 is running on, then this is the simplest way of getting it working. If you happen to have a real Linux machine which you have root privilege on, you can do the same procedure to get the files moved. Other methods for copying the files would be FTP, SMB, or any other method that you normally use for copying files onto and off of that machines access.	- ClintOn Nov 12, 2008, at 5:20 PM, Bob Nagel wrote:Hi Ali thanks for your answer, I do not know what you mean. Are you saying that I should create the Disk Image in another machine in which I have root privileges? and after how do I submit that disk image to the machine in which I have m5 installed?, I should run the simulation in that machine because it is much faster than mine. Thank you. 2008/11/12 Ali Saidi <saidi@umich.edu> No, you don't need to have root privileges on the machine that you're running M5 on, but you do need them on some system because the mount requires root privileges. You could run linux inside a VM or with a emulator such as Bochs for this purpose.
