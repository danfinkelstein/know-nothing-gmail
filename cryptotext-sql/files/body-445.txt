I don't think you're missing anything... it doesn't appear that the
replacement algorithm does anything special for invalidated blocks.
Of course, once the cache is warmed up, blocks will be invalidated
only due to coherence action, so there would have to be a lot of data
sharing for these blocks to cause a significant impact.
