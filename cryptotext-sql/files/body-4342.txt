Hi,
I just ran into the same problem that Jiayuan ran into a few weeks ago
(http://www.mail-archive.com/m5-users@m5sim.org/msg01121.html) - a bug that
had already been fixed in the internal tree.
It seems that it is happening quite frequently that people see bugs which are
already fixed in the internal tree (just search for "our tree" in the ML
archives). I was wondering if there is any way that you could allow public
access to your latest tree (maybe via a public SVN read access), to reduce
these kinds of problems.
Of course I'd also understand that there might be reasons for you not wanting
people to see/use your bleeding edge tree (unfinished/not working code etc.),
but I thought I'd just ask :-).
Best regards
Jonas
