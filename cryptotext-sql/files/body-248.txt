Thanks for the reply.I don't think that is the problem because the first pthread function called in the hello.cpp was correctly found.I was looking inside the pthreads library generated and I noticed that this pthread_join function wasn't listed there. I really can't imagine a reason.
To create the library I executed the following two lines:
sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -c pthread.c -o m5pthread.osparc64-unknown-linux-gnu-ar csr libm5pthread.a m5pthread.oFunny thing...- Show quoted text -On Tue, Apr 20, 2010 at 1:13 AM, nathan binkert <nate@binkert.org> wrote:

I think your link order is bad.  generally, -l options need to come
after object files, otherwise, the linker doesn't know to pull out the
relevant functions.  (The linker processes files in order.)
