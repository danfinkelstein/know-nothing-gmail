1) On a multiprocessor system, when a upgradeReq hits the global bus, the owner sends a UpgradeResp and all sharers invalidate their copy. The invalidation by sharers and UpgradeResp happens as a single transaction?
Yes. 
2) I observe some WriteReq packets on the global bus. on a Write miss ina last-level cache, does not the cache make a ReqReq packet and send it over the global bus. Are the WriteReq packets possibly from the I/O subsystem?
Yes.  One way to verify this is that the WriteReq packets should be for smaller sizes (1-8 bytes) and not for full cache lines (64 bytes). 
3) In the presence of UpgradeReq and UpgradeResp, why are the commands WriteInvalidateReq and WriteInvalidateResp needed in packt.hh?They're intended to be used for doing write-throughs to coherent blocks.  The cache model doesn't currently implement that though so they're basically unused in the current code base.
