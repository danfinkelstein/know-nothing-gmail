The detailed CPU is significantly slower than the AtomicCPU, so ls will probably eventually be run, but it's will take a while. Normally we checkpoint a certain amount of time after the checkpoint instruction after whatever benchmark of interest is running.
We use the following command line to restore from the checkpoint and switch to a detailed CPU. I don't know exactly what you're running so I can't be sure if there is a problem or not.
./build/ALPHA_FS/m5.fast configs/example/fs.py -t --caches --l2cache -s -w 200000000000 -r 1 --checkpoint_dir=....
Where -s stands for standard switching (to a detailed cpu), and -w says warmup the caches/tlb/etc for  200000000000 ticks with a simple cpu before switching.

Hi,
I am trying to create and restore checkpoints for
detailed CPU model in M5 v2.0b3.
But it is not restoring properly.
While taking checkpoint i am using AtomicSimpleCPU and
then using "m5 checkpoint" from command line after
booting finishes.
Next while restoring, i am giving the checkpoint with
--detailed switch.
It switches to timing mode and console goes to command
prompt. But after that it doesn´t respond to any
command. For example if i restore from checkpoint in
this way, in the console even "ls" is not responding.
Am i doing it correctly?
