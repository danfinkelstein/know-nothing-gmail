I've found a bug in the beta 3 release of M5.  When
running with more than one CPU and no L2 cache, I get an invalid transition
abort from the coherence code while booting linux in FS mode.
Just running this command line will produce the error:
 
build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt fs.py –t –n 4 –caches
 
I have looked at the problem in GDB and it appears the
problem is stemming from a packet getting on the memory bus that has a command
MemCmd::WriteReq, which is causing the error.
