I have checked the etherlink model and etherint model which
has an etherint peer. Once the peer is set, two etherints
on both ends of the etherlink are binded together. So a direct
point-to-point link is set. As you said, I can just create a
switch model with some interfaces and make each etherint bind
with a switch interface instead of the etherints on other
systems. However, this network topology is a kind of star
network which is different from the fully-connected network
because the etherint on one system is shared to connect with
other systems, sometimes causing the transmission delay.
I think each system should have N-1 etherints in order to
implement a fully-connected network of N systems. How do
you think of that?  I know there is a limit on PCI devices.
Do you think it possible to modify this limit? If yes, where
should I start with? Is this about the pci bus address limit?
