Hi all,
I want to build a multicore system in FS mode without the Ethernet.
The number of cores is two and I want to run different benchmarks on
different core. How could I change the fs.py ? And what else should I
do?
I have read the previous content in mailing list and find in Feb,
2007, someone wrote a part of script as follows:
"system = makeLinuxAlphaSystem(mem_mode, bm[0])
    system.cpu = [AtomicSimpleCPU(), AtomicSimpleCPU(),
AtomicSimpleCPU(), AtomicSimpleCPU()]
    system.cpu[0].connectMemPorts(system.membus)
    system.cpu[0].mem = system.physmem
    system.cpu[1].connectMemPorts(system.membus)
    system.cpu[1].mem = system.physmem
    system.cpu[2].connectMemPorts(system.membus)
    system.cpu[2].mem = system.physmem
    system.cpu[3].connectMemPorts(system.membus)
    system.cpu[3].mem = system.physmem
root = Root(clock = '1GHz', system = system)"
I wonder if he is right. If he is right, how to run two different
benchmarks. I think he just configure the same benchmark for all the
cpus.
Thank you very much!
Best regards,
Lei Shi
