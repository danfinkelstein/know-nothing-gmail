Hi all,
I add a page in M5 wiki FAQ to show how to run the SPEC2006 on M5 SE
mode. I am focusing on parallel programs now, so I don't have much
time to work on the SPEC2006. I re-simulated the whole SPEC2006 last
weekend to test the testing data set and get the timing results. This
wiki page shows what we have done so far at UMD. I hope our
experiences can help everyone who wants to simulate SPEC2006 on M5.
