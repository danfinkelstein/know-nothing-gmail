I want to simulate the following system:
A total of four cores each with L1 private L1 caches. Two cores connected by a shared bus. The other two cores also connected by a shared bus. The two clusters connected together by a point to point link or something.
In essence, the goal is to have two separate shared bus fabrics in the system.
Any idea how to model this in m5. I know m5 has this bridge mechanism but has anybody used it successfully?
Regards,
Shoaib
