Hello M5 Users,
The M5 team would like to announce the availability of the 3rd beta for M5 2.0.  This release is a major bugfix release over beta 2 and signifies a big step towards the final release.  We know that there's more work needed to shake out all of the bugs hiding in corner cases and to increase the M5's accuracy.  Everyone's help and patience is appreciated in this process.  We're striving for a solid 2.0 release and users can help by giving us feedback, filing bug reports, and providing patches.
Some highlights (check the RELEASE_NOTES for details):
- Some support for SPARC full-system simulation
- Reworking of trace facitities (parameter names changed)
- Scons script cleanups
- Some support for compiling with Intel CC
Bug fixes since beta 2:
