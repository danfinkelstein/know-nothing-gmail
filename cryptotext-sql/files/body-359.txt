The pseudo instructions are for use inside a program like you said, and
are actual assembly instructions recognized by M5. A program is provided
in util which, when run from a script, will run the requested assembly
instruction. That program is makes it easy to use those instructions
from a script, but it's entirely optional. That said, if you actually
want to trigger the ops using a particular address instead of using the
assembly instructions, then you don't want either of these approaches
which are for use from the simulation target. From inside the simulator
(ie the cache model) you can just call the functions the assembly
instructions end up calling which are in sim/pseudo_inst.cc. Even
better, you could use the same underlying mechanisms those functions use
directly, avoiding some unnecessary complications.
