Hi, all, I wonder when I added a device to the iobus, how does the kernel know it? I added it follow the instructions of the tutorial and I don't quite understand how to modify the console code to access it. Is it necessary to letter the linux know that M5 has a new component ? What should I do before I can access it from a device driver ? Thanks !
