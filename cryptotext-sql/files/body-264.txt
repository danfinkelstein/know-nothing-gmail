Hi Abhishek,
Getting superscalar inorder to work will most likely require some
minor tweaks. I say "most likely" because I tried it with
multiprogrammed workloads comprised of spec benchmarks on a
multithreaded in-order CPU and it did not work. There were minor bugs.
I got it working with very specific tweaks particular to what I wanted
to model. My changes are specific to dispatching multiple instructions
(at most one instruction from a one hardware thread) in an SMT
configuration. Your are using splash benchmarks and seem to be using
an in-order core without any multithreading support.
Korey, I think I should be able to find out one of my patches in which
the stagewidth can be set from python (I replaced some static arrays
with dynamic arrays). However, it doesn't make much sense to just add
that patch unless I fix the bugs that surface thereafter. I will try
to take out some time to work on it.
