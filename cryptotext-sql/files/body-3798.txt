Hi all,
 
We have a mesh interconnection model and I'm thinking about refine it 
and integrate it into M5. But I got several questions:
 
1.  it seems the bus is tightly coupled with address mapping 
(findPort(addr)). I don't understand why and how to implement the same 
functionality into the mesh. I'm planning to just identify ports with their IDs 
(plus a reserved ID for broadcasting). Is this okay?
 
2. I'm not sure what the snoop ports are for. In the splash2 SE 
script, the bus doesn't seem to have snoop ports. 
 
3. I assume the functionality of  the bus/interconnection is 
to forward packets from src to dst while modeling some sort of contention. Is 
there any other roles this module plays? Does the bus in M5 carry any 
responsibilities in coherence?
 
Thanks!
 
Jiayuan
