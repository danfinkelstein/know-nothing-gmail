Hi Min,
I think you are the first person to try the Ruby + OoO cpu combination.  I know I haven't tested and I don't believe the Wisconsin folks have either.  Right now Ruby is not fully integrated with all the features of M5 and I don't recommend transitioning from GEMS to ruby in M5 (GEM5) quite yet.
