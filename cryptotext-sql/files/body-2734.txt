In both cases take a look at the util directory. ccdrv is a kernel
module that times accesses to a memory location. While that part isn't
important you can see the use of the rpcc instruction to time events.
It's by far the highest resolution timer available.
To see how to insert a m5op into a binary take a loop at util/m5. The
directory contains the source to the m5 binary that we put on the disk
image to execute m5ops. You can see how we insert an operation into a
program as a asm constant and then wrap m5op so it can be called from C.
