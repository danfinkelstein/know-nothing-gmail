If you're just starting to get things up and running and haven't put a lot of effort into things, can you please use 2.0b2.  We're a bunch of academics and are willing to support our current stuff, but we're not very interested in getting people working on old code.  That said, we won't leave you hanging if you have a lot of time invested in 1.1, but would sill encourage you to switch.

I am using the DetailedCPU model and v1.1. How can I use the Sampler for switching between the Simple and detailed?
Thanks,

What CPU model are you using?  This would not be surprising if you're not using SimpleCPU.

Hi,
I have been trying to bring up a 4-CMP Full System setup, giving a Memory configuration of "OCM".
It has been more than 2 hours and the Linux kernel has still not finished booting up. Is it usual for it to take so long, as it seems quite weird.
Thanks,
Meeta
