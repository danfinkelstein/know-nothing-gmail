Figured it out. Copied the files to the binaries and disks directories
and could run configs/example/fs.py after that. One small thing
though. The names of the solaris binaries used in m5 have new as a
suffix ( for eg. openboot_new.bin and q_new.bin). Does it mean that
the original binaries from opensparc need to be modified in some way?
