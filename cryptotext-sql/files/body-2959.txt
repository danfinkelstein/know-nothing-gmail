Hi Ali,
I've been having problems creating a build of Linux 2.6.22 that matches
with the supported Tsunami platform in M5.  I think the source of
problems is incorrectly configuring the VGA device and I want to go back
to the configuration question (see below) that I asked a few weeks ago.
I noticed that the M5 patches make changes to the following files:
arch/alpha/Kconfig, arch/alpha/kernel/console.c, and
arch/alpha/kernel/proto.h.  In particular, these changes appear to allow
the DUMMY_CONSOLE to be built without the VGA_HOSE being defined.  To
avoid the define dependencies on VGA_HOSE, the changes also switch some
"#ifdef CONFIG_VGA_HOSE" lines to "#ifdef CONFIG_VGA_HOSE1".  Is my
understanding correct?
The problem with these changes is they appear incomplete without the
necessary changes to the config files.  Specifically, I assume one needs
to remove the dependency between VGA_HOSE and ALPHA_GENERIC in Kconfig.
Therefore, CONFIG_DUMMY_CONSOLE, CONFIG_ALPHA_GENERIC, and
CONFIG_ALPHA_LEGACY_START_ADDRESS are defined, while CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE,
CONFIG_VGA_HOSE, and CONFIG_VGA_HOSE1 are not defined.  The result is
the kernel builds with empty implementations of the
find_console_vga_hose() and locate_and_init_vga() functions.  Is my
configuration assumption correct?
So with the above configuration, I encounter a M5 assertion check that
appears to be caused by an incorrectly "faked" device.  In particular,
the following trace indicates the faulting address is 0x801fc0001ef
which maps in between the fake_ata0 and fake_ata1 devices.  I have a
sucpicion that this error is caused by the vga device not really being
removed, but I'm not sure.  What is your opinion?
1942464295500: testsys.membus: recvAtomic: packet src 3 dest -1 addr
0x801fc0001ef cmd ReadReq
1942464295500: testsys.membus: Unable to find destination for addr:
0x801fc0001ef, will use default port
1942464295500: testsys.membus.responder: Device testsys.membus.responder
read to bad address va=0x801fc0001ef size=1
Finally, I wanted to get a stack trace of the kernel when this error
occurs, but I'm having a problem calling the Linux kernel debugger from
the user-level debugger on M5.  The website
(http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Debugging_M5) indicates the kernel
debugger can be called by a 'call Debugger()' command, but I think that
is assuming the Debugger() function is defined?  Who defines the
Debugger function, because I receive a 'No symbol "Debugger" in current
context.' Error when I try to call the Debugger function from the M5
debugger.
Please let me know if any of my questions don't make sense.
Thanks for your help!
Brad

Hi Brad,
I created the other config files, but I don't have one for 2.6.22. If
you want one you should just start with the 2.6.18 config file and if
you attempt to make the kernel you'll get prompted for any new
parameters that weren't in 2.6.18.
