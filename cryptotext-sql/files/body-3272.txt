I'm not an expert in the syscall emulation stuff, but since nobody
responded, I'll give it a shot.
I'm not sure why this shouldn't be possible.  A CPU object takes a
workload parameter.  If multiple CPUs point to the same workload, then
they will attempt a multithreaded simulation of that workload.  If one
group of CPUs pointed to one workload and another group of CPUs
pointed to another, then I should think that you'd be able to run two
multithreaded workloads in parallel.  That said, I don't believe that
anyone has done this, so there could be a bug.  Please try it out and
let us know.  If any bugs do exist shouldn't be too tough to figure
out.
