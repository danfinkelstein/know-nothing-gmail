Hi Pritha,If your program is in assembly, then you'd just have to make changes to the Alpha assembler (in binutils). If your program is in C (or any other high level language), then you'd also have to make changes to the alpha machine description file (<gcc-root>/gcc/config/alpha/alpha.md) to specify how to emit your specialized instructions in assembly from GCC's RTL representation. You'll find information about it in the gcc internals documentation (http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/).

Could someone help us about how to do this and is there any other way? -- Pritha Ghoshal
