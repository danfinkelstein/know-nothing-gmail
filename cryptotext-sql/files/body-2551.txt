This has changed recently... the valid trace flags are defined by adding a line like:TraceFlag('Foo')to a SConscript file, typically the one in the same directory where you're using that flag.

hi all
i've  traced some information of memory access when running m5 by se.py...,i 've add something new into m5 and wanted to trace some information about accessing it, after doing that, i got the error "XXX is not the member of TRACE",  i guess there is a list to maintain all kinds of trace options like 'MemoryAccess, Cache, Bus...' , but i failed to get it... so how can i do that if i want to trace some information what i interested in, but not included in m5 currently...plz show me a light? thank u.
