Actually, M5 used to support this sort of thing, but nobody really
used it, so the code was removed to simplify the statistics.  You can
dump statistics multiple times and do the proper post processing.
It's probably best that you explain in a little bit more detail
exactly what you're trying to accomplish so we can help you.
