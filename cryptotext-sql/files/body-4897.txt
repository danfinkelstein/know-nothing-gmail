Hi,
I just downloaded M5 and was running the SurgeSpecweb benchmark on full system.
I used the given fs.py script to run the benchmark. However, after many cycles,
the simulation gave a fatal error on line 316 of src/sim/main.cc. The reported
num_cycles was -5034415120011. What could be the problem? How should I fix it?
Thanks,
Christopher
