Hello,
I want to statically link all shared libraries to m5 so that I can run
the m5.opt on another machine. I tried to do this by adding a CCFLAG
-static to the Sconscript, but I still got the following error on the
remote machine:
./m5.opt: error while loading shared libraries: libpython2.6.so.1.0:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
How do I do this?
Thanks,
Felix
