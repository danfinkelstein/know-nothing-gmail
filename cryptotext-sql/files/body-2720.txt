The best documentation is probably:
http://m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Simulation_Scripts_Explained
Unfortunately, this leaves out most of the details.  Basically, we use
the .py files that describe the parameters (like BaseCache.py) to
autogenerate a C++ parameter structure, wrap that structure with swig
and add that stuff to the build environment.
