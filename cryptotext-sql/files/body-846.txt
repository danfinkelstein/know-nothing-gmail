Hi,I saw a post in the user archives explaining the MP simulation as follows:you can simulate multiple processors on a coherent bus as long as (1) there is only one
bus that has multiple caches connected to it and (2) there is only onelevel of cache above the shared bus.  That is, like this:
CPU --- L1 --|                  |--- MEM
CPU --- L1 --|or like this:
CPU --- L1 --|                  |--- L2 --- MEM
CPU --- L1 --|but NOT like this:
CPU --- L1 --- L2 --|                           |--- MEM
CPU --- L1 --- L2 --|Has the situation been changed?  Any improvement? Can multiple L1 and L2 be above the shared bus now and with different latecy buses between L1 and L2 pairs?
thanks,di
