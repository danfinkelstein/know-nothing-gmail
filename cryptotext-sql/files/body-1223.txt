Thanks for the reply. Test is indeed Not failing in the loop but at the following statement in handleResponse().
MSHR::Target *initial_tgt = mshr->getTarget();
I believe the cache is receiving two separate Upgrade responses for a single Upgrade request it initiated. I am modeling a system with distributed ordering points (more like two clusters with each having a shared bus and a snoop filter in the middle). I thought the coherence protocol ensuring a single owner will prevent that from happening.
