Hi all,
 I am trying to run splash2 bmarks in FS mode (M5 v2 beta 3). I gave the
paths to the linux image, disk image in the syspaths.py file. I modified
the benchmarks.py file to add a splash2 benchmark as:
'splash2_fft':      [SysConfig('splash2_fft_4.rcS', '512MB',
'splash-2.img')]
in the Benchmarks{} section.
The rcS file is present in system/boot directory.
When I try to run the simulation by giving the command:
./build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt configs/example/fs.py -b splash2_fft
it runs for a while and then aborts giving the error:
1815891248500: system.cpu0.break_event: break event panic triggered
panic: M5 panic instruction called at pc=0xfffffc000031d7a0.
 @ cycle 1815990793500
[execute:build/ALPHA_FS/arch/alpha/atomic_simple_cpu_exec.cc, line
11834]
Program aborted at cycle 1815990793500
How do I get the splash2 bmarks running? Has anyone run these in FS mode
with m5 v2beta3?
Thanks,
Sujay
