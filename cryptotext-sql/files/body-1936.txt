Hmmm.  I never responded to this.  Anyway, M5 doesn't do these things.
 The operating system does, so you have to query the running operating
system to find out the information.  If you need very accurate
statistics, you can do more sophisticated things of course by hacking
m5 and the kernel, but for what you want, it seems that you just need
to learn more about how to get this info from Linux.
