Can you be more specific about this page fault?  Does it occur in a repeatable spot, what kind of address is it, etc.Steve- Show quoted text -On 7/25/07, Nicolas Zea

processes from one cpu to another, as well as having "floatingprocesses" which do not start on any cpu until a later time. I'mrunning into an issue with getting a page fault when I try to load

are initialized to be different benchmarks in the configuration file.Currently, I perform the following when attempting to load anuninitialized process onto a core for the first time (where thecpu isthe cpu object I want to run the new process on):
(note: I drain the cpu first to make sure the previous process is ina steady state)                ((AlphaTC<AlphaSimpleImpl> *)(thecpu->threadContexts[0]))->thread- >process = pkt->proc;  // attach the process
                thecpu->registerThreadContexts();       // register the process                pkt->proc->startup();   // perform the initial write of program datainto memory                thecpu->resume();       // resume the cpu
This seems to work, as watching the fetch shows that things arehappening, but inevitably I get a page fault. Any ideas?-Nick_______________________________________________m5-users mailing list
