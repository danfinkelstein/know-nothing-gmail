Hi all,
I'm new to M5. Is there any tutorial or document about how to write the script which is used to configure the system and run the simulation, except http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Simulation_Scripts_Explained?
For example, if I want to configure a multi-core system which 4 cores have their own L1 caches but share a common L2 cache, how to write the script?
Thanks.
