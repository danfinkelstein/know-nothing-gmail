(I feel like I or someone else has asked this before, but I can't seem to
find it in the archives.)
Does M5 call a specific function at the end of simulation (similar to the
calls to regStats() at the beginning of simulation) for cleanup code?  I
need to do some additional processing at the end of simulation (before stats
are calculated and printed) and was wondering if there's a standard place I
can put my code.  I can't seem to find anything like this in the code or
documentation, but thought I may be missing something.
What exactly are you trying to do?  There's a function called registerResetCallback that might be what you want.  If not, it'd probably be easy enough to add a registerDumpCallbakc that would occur when dump is called.
