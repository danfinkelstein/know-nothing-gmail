I made some changes to memory system and collected data for several uniprocessor experiemts.However, for multiprogramming workloads I ran into this assertion at switch of cpus.
m5.opt: build/ALPHA_SE/cpu/simple/atomic.cc:202: virtual void AtomicSimpleCPU::resume(): Assertion `system->getMemoryMode() == Enums::atomic' failed.
Any idea whats wrong? I use --fast-forward=X --max-inst=Y to fast forwarding.
