Hi, I am working on the same problem.  I haven't completely solved it yet but something to think about:  you are compiling on 2.6 but what kernel are you booting in M5?  It may be that you're statically linking with the wrong versions of glibc or something which causes a segfault.

I use m5-stable-94c016415053,
cross compiler is alphaev67-unknown-linux-gnu,  gcc version 4.3.2
(crosstool-NG-1.3.3)
System file is m5_system_2.0b3.
The problem is when I run ALPHA_FS, I can only run the pre installed
benchmark on the disk image.  I try to compile a simple hello world program
and mount the image, copy it in. When I run it, I get a segmentation fault.
My host machine is openSUSE 11, with kernel 2.6.25.16, gcc version 4.3.2
Is there anything in cross compling? Now I just type:
alphaev67-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/alphaev67-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -static
hello.c
