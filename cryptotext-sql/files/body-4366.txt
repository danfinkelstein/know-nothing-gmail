The wiki allows registered users to create new pages, but I don't believe it's setup to deal with uploaded files at this point. The problem with data sets is that most of them have redistribution clauses in their licenses. Anyway, if there is some stuff that doesn't have licensing issues that you want to post we would be glad to put it on the m5 website, but we'll probably just want to put it there manually.Ali- Show quoted text -On Aug 21, 2007, at 5:47 PM, Daniel Alex Finkelstein wrote:- Show quoted text -FWIW, I have the full SPEC CPU 2000 suite compiled for Alpha/Linux. Can the m5 wiki take submissions from registered users? Maybe we might want to post data sets, scripts, and even (open) binaries for others to reference and try out.--DOn Aug 7, 2007, at 10:30 AM, Dean Michael Ancajas wrote:Btw, I got the Alpha Binaries of SPEC 2000 from the SimpleScalar website(and a little bit of searching around the bushes).
