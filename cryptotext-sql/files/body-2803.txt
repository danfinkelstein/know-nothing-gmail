I'm not familiar with the details of wattch, so I'll have to ask as
many questions as I answer here...
How frequently are the computations in power.c performed?  If they're
infrequent, you could move all that code into python where it would
have direct access to the python parameters.
How modular is the power code?  It seems inelegant that the
system-level power model would care about the implementation details
of the individual cores.  If there was a way for each SimObject to own
its own little piece of the power model, then finding the parameters
should be easy... the CPU knows how big its LSQ is, the problem is in
getting that information out of the CPU model when not every CPU has
an LSQ.  Similarly the System object knows how many CPUs there are in
that system, so if you can do the system-level power modeling right
there (or in a subordinate object) then it shouldn't be hard.  Note
that when you're doing multi-system simulations you probably don't
want to roll up the power consumption across all the systems, since
some of the systems are just drivers to create traffic for the system
under test.
As a last resort you could create a SimObject just for the power model
and then have the python pass the needed params in (you could probably
even set the python up to grab all those param values
semi-automatically) but the more I think about it that seems to be a
cop-out relative to having the power model itself be more modular.
But given the state of the existing code and your time constraints it
might be your best course of action.
