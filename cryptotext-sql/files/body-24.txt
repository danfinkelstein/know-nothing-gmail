  
Thanks for the hints, Korey.
I'll use them later to pinpoint the location of the deadlock.
There is one additional thing I should've written in the previous
e-mail:
The AtomicCPU executes 2,1*10^9 insts while the InOrderCPU executes
1,82*10^9 insts for CRC.- Show quoted text -

What is the expected number of instructions for your

What is the number in the stats file after it exits?
  
The answers to those questions will help you find where the deadlock
point potentially is.
  
Also, if you turn the progress intervals on you can see where the
deadlock potentially is at well because you start seeing intervals of 0
instructions. (--prog_intvl=X on the command line.)

  Hi
all,
    
After executing a subset of MiBench I received this exit cause for a
few benchmarks:
Exiting @ cycle 9223372036854775807 because simulate() limit reached
    
CRC32 and gsm encode with the large input set are the two benchmarks
that cause this message.
    
On the mailing list I read that this happens due to deadlocking for
example.
However, I run this code on a single InOrderCPU and I don't see where
CRC could possibly deadlock. Besides, it executes correctly on the
Atomic CPU.
    
Does anybody have ideas about possible causes? Or did anybody ran
CRC32/gsm encode large on the InOrderCPU to completeness?
    
    
Regards,
    
Max
