Hi all, I am reading the source code of M5, but I can not find where the effective address of a memory access instruction calculated. I thought that the address should be calculated in the IEW stage, so I searched in the iew_impl.hh, lsq_impl.hh and lsq_unit_impl.hh, I only found the executeLoad/executeStore functions, but those functions seem do something else. 
Can anyone tell me where should I find? Where a memory access instuction is actually executed? Thand you!
