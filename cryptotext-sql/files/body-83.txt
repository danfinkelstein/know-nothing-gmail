Hi Sheng,Try using the cleanupRefs() function in the cache tags implementation you are using. Â This function is called back at the end of simulation and you can have it walk through the cache blocks and do whatever you like, including increment/decrement statistics.

Hi all,i want to know the cache block's status at the very end of the simulation. like how many L2 cache blocks are dirty and so on. Does anyone know how to get this information? if i can scan all L2 cache blocks at the very end of the simulation, i think i can make it but how to do this?
Thanks,Sheng
