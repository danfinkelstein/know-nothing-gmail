I'm a new user running m5;
When I try to start m5 up I run into an error "access out of bounds"
and am directed to file [read:build/ALPHA_FS/dev/disk_image.cc].
Said source file exists, but is empty.  How do I go about
replacing/restoring it?This should be a symbolic link to src/dev/disk_image.cc.  If it's not, then something went wrong with scons; I'd "rm -rf build" and recompile from scratch.  If src/dev/disk_image.cc doesn't exist, you must have accidentally deleted it.
 
While I am at it, is where can I find the panic method, or
documentation on how it works?See src/base/misc.hhSteve 
Thanks,
Adam
