Hello,
I got SpecOMP to run on M5 ALPHA_FS, so I can provide some pointers.
First, I compiled a cross compiler with crosstool-0.43.  The toolchain version
that I use is  gcc-4.2.4-glibc-2.3.6-tls (you need gcc-4.2 for OpenMP support).
 It seems to work right away without any tweaking.  To get fortran compiler,
just add it to the list of languages in demo-alpha.sh file.
You don't need to compile SpecOMP statically, just make sure you include the
-fopenmp flag.  Finally, copy the library files from
gcc-4.2.4-glibc-2.3.6/alpha-unknown-linux-gnu/alpha-unknown-linux-gnu/lib to the
/lib directory on the disk image.
I hope that helps.
Giang
