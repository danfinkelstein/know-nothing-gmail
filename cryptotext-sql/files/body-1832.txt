Yes. This is actually a pretty common error when installing Gentoo.
You need to modify /etc/fstab to reflect your mount points instead of
the dummy values /dev/ROOT, etc. The image your using is supposed to
be a starting point for installing Gentoo so it won't be quite ready
to boot right away. I can't think of anything off the top of my head
beyond setting up fstab that's absolutely necessary, though.
