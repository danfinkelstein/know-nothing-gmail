That means X86_FS is available, not that we expect it to work perfectly.
You're definitely welcome to use it and we appreciate any feedback you
can give (especially bug fixes), but you may run into problems.

You don't need to apply any patches to the linux kernel to get it work.
Like I said above it may not work either way (I'm hopeful it will), but
those patches are solely to make running the kernel in M5 "nicer" by
optimizing idle loops, loading symbol tables when kernel modules are
installed, etc. I believe there are patches specifically for x86 (you
might already be using them), but I don't remember what state they're in
or exactly how to set them up.
