Hi Bhushan,  We haven't run across this issue in the context of checkpointing using our infrastructure.  However, I did have this problem when I was trying to modify M5, and I believe its caused by scheduling issues in the event queue.  I have a couple questions:
   1) Have you made any modifications to M5?  If so, are they timing related?   2) Are you using the same simulated system and kernel image?  Thanks,  Joel

I haven't ever seen this error. It looks like from his commands that
is doing everything right so I am not sure why it is crashing.
