Hi, folks,I have a quick question about dumping statistics and terminating the M5 simulation after a predefined number of accesses to the last level cache, during which I would like to characterize the LLCÂ behavior. Can anyone tell me how I can achieve this goal?
Thanks,Leonard-- Give our ability to our work, but our genius to our life!
