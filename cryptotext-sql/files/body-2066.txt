Isuru,I think probably your only bet is to go with FS mode.  Like you found, there is no thread scheduler in SE mode for M5, so running a non-SPLASH multi-threaded workload would be more trouble than it's worth.
In FS mode, since you'd be running actual Linux, you'd have access to a real thread scheduler and the bind system call would actually work.Good luck.Lisa- Show quoted text -On Thu, Jan 8, 2009 at 12:22 PM, Isuru Herath <isuru81@yahoo.com> wrote:
Dear All,
I am trying to run a multi-threaded matrix multiplication program on a ALPHA CMP
system under SE mode. The program is written in c and uses CPU_SET to bind a
thread to a core. (I am not a good c programmer so please dont ask me how this
works, I got the code from a friend.)
I used a alpha cross compiler to compile this and resulted binaries were given
to the cmp configuration file. Then it gives me an error saying
fatal: syscall _sysctl (#319) unimplemented.
 @ cycle 1056500
[unimplementedFunc:build/ALPHA_SE/sim/syscall_emul.cc, line 73]
After searching through the mailing list I found following links which explains
how to run splash2 in SE.
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.m5.users/1364/focus=1365
and
http://m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Splash_benchmarks
But in the link
(http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.m5.users/3542/focus=3553) Steve is
saying "There is no thread scheduler in SE mode, so you can't have more threads
than cores.". Which made me think if I have one thread per core will I be able
run it in SE mode?
If it is possible any advice/help in this regard is greatly appreciated.
regards,
Isuru
