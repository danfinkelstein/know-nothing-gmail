Buses serialize all accesses, so the memory controller cannot see any
contention caused by simultaneous accesses. Modern memory controllers
(which DRAMsim models) are designed to overlap as many operations as
possible, so precisely defining what it means for two requests that do
not arrive simultaneously to contend with each other is a difficult
thing to do. This contention instead occurs at the bus. You might want
to look and see if bus contention is at all an issue for your program.
An effective cache hierarchy mostly eliminates memory access contention.
