I don't believe that there is a fundamental reason that you can't
build M5 with visual studio 2008 or visual studio 2008 express  (don't
try an earlier version).  That said it would probably take a few days.
 If you do decide to go down this road, please share your experience
with the list as I would love to try to integrate support.  I'd also
suggest using SCons and not converting the build environment.
