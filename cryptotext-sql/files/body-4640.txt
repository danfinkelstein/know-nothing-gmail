I can move to 2.0b2. I had issues earlier with the compilation and hence had gone with v1.1 .
Right now i cannot get the files in encumbered/cpu/full to be a part of my compilation. It picks the eio files but not the cpu/full files. Is there anything i need to change to make it compile that directory too?
the FullCpu is disabled by default.  scons --help gives you the scons options, the one you're interested in is CPU_MODELS= for selecting which ones are compiled in.  We don't use FullCPU anymore.  Is there a reason you want that?  We're now working on the O3 CPU model.
And can you also tell me how to add the sampler support in fs.py?
I'll let someone else respond about this since they wrote the code (kevin? lisa?), but I think there should be some code about doing sampling in the example files.  Just so you know, sampling is handled much differently now in 2.0.- Show quoted text -
