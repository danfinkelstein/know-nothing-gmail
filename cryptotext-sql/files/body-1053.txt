I am sorry for rushing this one out but thanks for your reply anyway. If you did go throguh the diagram, the problem is that I have extra snoop ports in caches, and a snoop bus as shown. When recvTiming is called on snoopPorts, I call myCache->snoopTiming(). But in bus.cc, when pkt with dest=-1 hits the snoop bus, sendTiming() is not called on all snoopPorts of other caches. (How MemInhibitAsserted was true is another story but I got that one.)
Now my question would be how to register ports on a bus as snoop ports. I thought it was done automatically? The implementation of SnoopPorts in cache is similar to MemSidePorts.
