  Not a built in way, no. You could add a parameter to the stats 
  and only print ones that had that parameter set to true. All the stats are 
  already printed into the m5stats.txt file that shows up in the output 
  directory (by default '.'). If you name your stats something like 
  jiayuan_xxxxxxxxxxx it would be very easy to grep for jiayuan_ and get only 
  the stats you're interested in.

    Sorry, I meant statitics package in M5. I was 
    trying to follow unittest/stattest.cc.
     
    I defiend a bunch of Stats::Scalar<> types, 
    and used the following code to print out the stats at the end of the 
    simulation (I inserted into the end of the main loop in 
    sim/simulate.cc):
      Text 
    out(cout);  out.descriptions = true;  out.compat 
    = false;  out();
     
    and at the end, a lot more bonus statistics are 
    printed out. Is there any way to turn off the default stats 
    and turn on only my own stats?
     
    Thanks!

        Hi all,
         
        I am trying to use M5's stat utility. But when i try 
        to output the stats that I defined, i found a lot more stats than I 
        expected.
        is there anyway to allow the output just show some 
        particular stats?
         
        Thanks!
