Hi All,
I am implementing a page migration mechanism, where I would want to
remap a virtual address to a different physical page. I am using M5 in
the SE mode. I am trying to do the following for the same: 1) Allocate
a new page, 2) Flush dirty cache blocks corresponding to that page, 3)
Flush the TLB entry for that page, 4) Copy contents to the new page,
5) Modify the page table to map the virtual address to the new page. I
have already implemented all these steps except 2), i.e. the cache
flushing part. The implementation looks fine to me, as the simulation
without caches (page migration enabled) runs absolutely fine.
Although I have already spent some time with the cache code of M5, I
am still not sure how to accomplish the flushing part. It would be
great if someone more familiar with the code can give me some insights
on how to go about implementing it. Also, is there a way to configure
caches as write-through, so that I might not need to flush the dirty
cache blocks?
Thanks in advance,
-Gaurav
