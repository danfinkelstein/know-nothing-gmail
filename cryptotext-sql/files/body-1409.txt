There have been a lot of coherence bug fixes since beta5.  I'd recommend upgrading to the head of the m5 development tree and seeing if that works for you.Steve- Show quoted text -On Fri, May 29, 2009 at 10:17 PM, Shoaib Akram <sakram3@illinois.edu> wrote:
Thanks Steve for the reply. Things seem to be working fine for 8 cpus but with more than this I have an assertion failure.
Assertion `target->pkt->cmd == MemCmd::ReadResp from cache_impl.hh (809, m5-beta5, cache patches applied).
This is happening in handleResponse() after satisfying cpuSide request. The packet is inValidate but the cmd is not ReadResp.
Do u have any idea?
