Hi,
   I have added spec2000 binaries and input sets into image disk. But I
cannot run these benchmarks correctly. These spec2000 binaries can be
run in
SE mode correctly.
   This is the simulation output I get when I run ammp:
   ......
   mounting filesystems...
   EXT2-fs warning: checktime reached, running e2fsck is recommended
   loading script...
   modprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No
such file or directory
   modprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No
such file or directory
   /tmp/script: line 11: ./ammp00.peak.ev6: cannot execute binary file
   Here is the ammp.rcS file I wrote:
   #!/bin/sh
   cd /benchmarks/spec/ammp/
   ./ammp00.peak.ev6 < ammp.in
   /sbin/m5 exit
   Does anyone know what is the problem?
Tracy
