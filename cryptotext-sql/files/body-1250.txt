Looking at the SConscript, it seems that it hasn't been compiled in
quite some time.  That said, a trace player should be pretty simple to
get working again.  We used to support an M5 format as well as an
intel and an IBM format.  If you do get these working again, we'd
really appreciate it if you were to submit patches.
