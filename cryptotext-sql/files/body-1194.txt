Thanks for your replies.All I did were the following (from <m5-root-dir>):1. Made a copy of the test (although this appears to serve only as gold ouputs):% cp -r tests/quick/01.hello-2T-smt/ref/alpha tests/quick/01.hello-2T-smt/ref/sparc
2. Ran the testcase:% scons build/SPARC_SE/tests/fast/quick/01.hello-2T-smtWhat steps should I take to debug this further?regards,Soumyaroop.- Show quoted text -On Mon, Jul 13, 2009 at 8:20 PM, Steve Reinhardt <stever@gmail.com> wrote:
It's also a sign of a deadlock... perhaps there's a deadlock situation that's not covered by the assertion.

The error suggests that you do not have anything on the main event
queue. Please check if you are making the proper call to schedule
events correctly on the main event queue.
