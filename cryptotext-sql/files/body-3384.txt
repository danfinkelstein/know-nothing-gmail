Hello all,
    I am trying to run the specint benchmarks in SE mode in beta 5, using m5.fast. I am facing errors with some of them as follows:
I am running them on a machine with 2GB ram. I made the correction to the cpu2000.py script as suggested by Vilas in previous postings.
1. mcf -
warn: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...
warn: Increasing stack size by one page.
fatal: Out of memory, please increase size of physical memory.
 @ cycle 45551000
[new_page:build/ALPHA_SE/sim/system.cc, line 235]
It means exactly what it says. You have a physical memory of probably 128MB, and the binary used all the available memory. Increase the size of the PhysicalMemory Object.
2. parser -
AttributeError: OptionParser instance has no __call__ method. I
think it needs input thru STDIN but does not seem to work
You've managed to grab the wrong module. There is a paser benchmark, and a parser python module. You've called the latter. Instead of from XXXX import * lines you should use import XXXX and then call XXX.callable()
3. amongst the specint benchmarks, perlbmk and bzip2 do not have a smred
input set. So what input_set options do we have to pass on?
You can use any of the defined input sets. I believe the minnespec benchmarks for bzip just used different parameters.
Also, how do we check if the benchmarks ran correctly or no?
By comparing the output to the reference output
Has anyone gotten all these to run correctly?
thanks,
Sujay
