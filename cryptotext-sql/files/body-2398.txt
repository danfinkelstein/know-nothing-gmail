For M5 developper or anyone who can help:This is Jiao, a student of ECE department of Northeastern Univ., and I am trying to use M5 full system in my research. It is a great tool for our research, but if we can have access to the M5 OS (Linux 2.6.13), that will be much more helpful. I tried to create disk images and kernel for  M5 according to the document from M5 main website - "Using linux-dist to Create Disk Images and Kernels for M5", but face the following difficulties:There are three steps to build up disk images:(1):  compile a cross-compiler capable of building alpha binaries.In this step, I followed the instructions to use crosstool 0.42, make change
 to demo-alpha.sh and gcc-3.4.3-glibc-2.3.5.dat. But when I run the demo-alpha.sh to install the cross-compiler, it showed error of "linux-libc-headers-2.6.13.0.tar.bz2 not exist". I went to the website: ftp://ftp.lfs-matrix.net/pub/linux-libc-headers/ and found the lastest header is linux-libc-headers-2.6.12.0.tar.bz2. Could anybody explain to me what this header is for and where to get the version linux-libc-headers-2.6.13.0.tar.bz2? Since the lastest version is 2.6.12.0, so I just use it for demo-alpha.sh and successfully generate the cross-compiler gcc-3.4.3-glibc-2.3.5.(2):  compile a
 kernel using this cross-compilerFor this step, I download kernel linux-2.6.13 and try to use cross-compiler gcc-3.4.3-glibc-2.3.5 to build it using command:make ARCH=alpha CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/crosstool/gcc-3.4.3-glibc-2.3.5/alpha-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/alpha-unknown-linux-gnu- vmlinuxBut I got the following errors: In file included from arch/alpha/kernel/asm-offsets.c:11:include/asm/io.h: In function `ioport_map':include/asm/io.h:273: warning: implicit declaration of function `__IO_PREFIX_ioportmap'include/asm/io.h:273: warning: return makes pointer from integer without a castinclude/asm/io.h: In function `ioremap':include/asm/io.h:282: warning: implicit declaration of function `__IO_PREFIX_ioremap'include/asm/io.h:282: warning: return makes pointer from integer without a castinclude/asm/io.h: In function `iounmap':include/asm/io.h:299: warning:

Does that because I use the wrong header in step 1 or because I didn't get the right kernel? If it is kernel probelm, can anyone please let me know where to get the right kernel?Thanks, Jiao
