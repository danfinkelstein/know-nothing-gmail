Hello,
    I am trying to add out-of-order memory access scheduling in m5_2.0b3.
My new dram model is derived from physicalMemory. I create a new
memory port and re-implement recvTiming() & recvAtomic() in the
derived memory port class.  When the latency for a packet is
calculated, I call sendTiming() to send out the latency. In the new
recvTiming(), I remove the sendTiming().
    In my algorithm, there are two functions: access() and tick().
access() is used to schedule the memory access and calculate the latency.
tick() is used to check the memory access status every memory cycle.
    After compile the code and run the simulation, I found my recvTiming()
is called only once, and tick() is continuously called. The simulation
is in an infinite loop.
    Does anyone know what is wrong?
Thanks,
Rongrong
