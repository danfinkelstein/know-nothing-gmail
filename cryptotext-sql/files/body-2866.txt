Hi guys:
I want to have the following configuration in m5. Is it feasible?
I hope there is 8 cpu, each cpu has its private L1 cache and L2 cache.
L2 cache is not shared by all cpu. Then I split the main memory into 8
banks. If cpu 1 wants to access main memory, it will access the bank 1
firstly. cpu 2 will access bank 2 firstly. ...
Can I realize the idea above?
thanks
claker
