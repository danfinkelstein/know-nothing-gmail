Just to clarify: it's using BaseBufferArg::copyIn() and not
VirtualPort::CopyIn(), right?  I just noticed that these are two
different functions with totally opposite semantics (explaining Ali's
earlier confusion).
Can you print the values of 'size' and 'getSize()' at the point in
Packet::checkFunctional() where you get this assertion failure?  One
solution is probably to do the readFunctional() in smaller chunks, but
I don't know what size chunks it's already using.  If it's trying to
do the whole buffer and we need to do it in cache-block chunks, that's
reasonable.  If it's already doing cache-block chunks and still
failing, then that's a little more puzzling.
