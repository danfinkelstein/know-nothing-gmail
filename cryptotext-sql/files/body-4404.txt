Hello,
   I tried to use DetailedO3CPU(which is defined in
m5_2.0b/m5/configs/common/FullO3Config.py) in my simulation, but it
failed.
In the .err file:
    warn: This DRAM module has not been tested with the new memory system at
    all!
    panic: Simulator object type 'DerivO3CPU' not found.
    @ cycle 0
    [createObject:build/ALPHA_FS/sim/builder.cc, line 121]
   DerivO3CPU is defined in phthon/m5/objects/O3CPU.py. Why the error
message says this object type is not found? How to solve this problem?
Thanks,
Tracy
