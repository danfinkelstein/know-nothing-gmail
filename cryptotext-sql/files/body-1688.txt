Hi all,
 
I am reading the codes of AtomicSimpleCPU and have 
some questions.
 
1. The PCEventQueue. I have not figured out 
what the PCEventQueue class is used for. Specifically, In the 
"tick()" function of AtomicSimpleCPU I don't know what the 
"checkPcEventQueue()" is used for. Can you exlpain more detail 
about PCEventQueue's member function "doService"? 
 
2. I am testing running two identical 
programs on two AtomicSimpleCPU objects. At anytime during execution, when 
I find a instruction in CPU1, I want to find the corresponding instruction in 
CPU2. Can I achieve this by finding the same PC in CPU2, with the tick number 
curTick? (For the same instructions at the same point of execution line, will 
the PCs also be  the same during the execution?). Actually what 
I want to do is to synchronize the two threads and do 
some data communication work.  
 
Thank you very much for your help!
 
Fei
