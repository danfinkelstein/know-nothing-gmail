Hi,
I am adding support to dynamically set structure parameters sizes in
wattch and want to pass the struct DerivO3CPUParams to the wattch
initialization section. The easiest way to do this for every cpu  to
initialize its wattch structure during initialization of the cpu class.
I decided to put the initialization call in
src/cpu/cpu.cc::FullO3CPU(...) constructor  and pass params
(Impl::Params) to the wattch initialization function. I then included
params/DerivO3CPU.hh in the wattch file, but the compiler does not like
this. I also tried to do a dynamic_cast<DerivO3CPUParams>(params) where
params is Impl::Params of src/cpu/cpu.hh::FullO3CPU class. I have
resigned that I have no idea how the params system is working ... lol.
So my question is, what file do I have to include in wattch so I can
access the Impl::params parameter of FullO3CPU after I pass it to the
function. Also, do I need to do a dynamic_cast? If you could point me to
an example, that would be equally helpful.
