This assertion is also in the latest version. My simulations complete successfully when I remove the insertion. I think the assertion is placed by mistake and the problem is intuitive.
Consider:
The packet the cache receives is ReadRespWithInvalidate
now goes the code:
if(pkk->isInvalidate()){
    assert(tgt->pkt->cmd=MemCmd::ReadResp)
}
The assertion should fail because the command is ReadRespWithInvalidate, not just ReadResp.
Anyone lse has trouble with this?
