Hello,
         I 
downloaded the latest version in the repo and was running the tests for SE mode. 
The long tests run correctly but with the quick tests I get the following 
error:
 
build/ALPHA_SE/m5.opt -d 
build/ALPHA_SE/tests/opt/quick/20.eio-short/alpha/eio/simple-atomic tests/run.py 
quick/20.eio-short/alpha/eio/simple-atomic > 
build/ALPHA_SE/tests/opt/quick/20.eio-short/alpha/eio/simple-atomic/stdout 2> 
build/ALPHA_SE/tests/opt/quick/20.eio-short/alpha/eio/simple-atomic/stderrscons: 
*** [build/ALPHA_SE/tests/opt/quick/20.eio-short/alpha/eio/simple-atomic/stdout] 
Error 1
 
What does this mean? Do we need to downloaded the 
encumbered files? I dont remember having done this when I was using M5 beta 4 or 
5.
 
Thanks,
Sujay
