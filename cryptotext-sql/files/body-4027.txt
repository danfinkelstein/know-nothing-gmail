2. Since python is used to create the structs automatically, how many files do we need to modify to add, say, one extra parameter.
  for eg: in dram.cc, if I want to have a new parameter, do I still need to declare it in the relevant sections in all of the:
dram.cc
dram.hh
PhysicalMemory.hh
You only add the parameter to PhysicalMemory.hh.  You can then access it through the params()-> function
