 Looking at the output you've shown there are top possibilities. 1) The disk image you're using is wrong, broken, corrupt. 2) You've found a bug in the simulator. I would guess (1) because if (2) was the problem I think we would have seen it before. One thing to is make sure that the splash image you got from someone else has a /bin directory and such. It might just have the splash benchmarks on it in which case the error makes perfect sense.Ali- Show quoted text -On Nov 1, 2007, at 1:50 PM, Sujay Phadke wrote:- Show quoted text - Hi all, I am trying to run splash2 bmarks in FS mode (M5 v2 beta 3). I gave thepaths to the linux image, disk image in the syspaths.py file.

Is there  some incompatibility between that and the new M5, wrt calling the init function?   How do I get the splash2 bmarks running? Has anyone run these in FS modewith m5 v2beta3?Thanks,Sujay_______________________________________________m5-users mailing listm5-users@m5sim.orghttp://m5sim.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/m5-users _______________________________________________
