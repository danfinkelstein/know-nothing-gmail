Thanks a lot Steve!
I am trying to model a CMP architecture. I think at this stage, I will not
model OS. I would prefer to run with syscall emulation mode. So I have two
following questions:
1. is it possible to simulate a CMP under SE mode? If so, do you have any
example scripts on configuring the CMP architecture? (in configs/example,
se.py has only one SimpleCPU configured)
2. Since I have to run threads on this configuration with SE mode, I will
need to implement some thread creation/termination primitives in the
simulator. There might be other primitives as well. This may involve: adding
more ops to the ISA, adding a load balancer unit to the simulator that
creates threads (allocate stack size, set per-thread stack pointers, passing
thread contexts). Would you please give some hints on how to implement these
in M5?
Thanks!

Subject: Re: [m5-users] question on test code compilation
M5 can run pthreads binaries in full-system mode, which means you're
restricted to Alpha for now.
There are directions on building a gcc-based cross compiler here:

nd_Kernels_for_M5
Note that you just need to follow the first section (on building the
cross compiler); the other parts on building a new kernel are
unnecessary if you're just compiling new applications.
