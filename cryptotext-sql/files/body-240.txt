> 4) The memory trace for my simulations are very large (around 10GB for a simulation). I commented most DPRINTF functions and only leave hits and misses, but it is still too large for me. Does anybody have this problem before? And is there a way in M5 to sample the trace by setting a time interval?
You can specify --trace-start on the command line which will tell the
simulator to delay tracing until a certain tick.  If you're debugging
in gdb, you can also do:
(gdb) call setTraceFlag("MyFlag")
or
(gdb) call clearTraceFlag("MyFlag")
