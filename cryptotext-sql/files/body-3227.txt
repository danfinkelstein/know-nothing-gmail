Hi,
I'm trying to execute splash2 benchmark with m5 2.0 beta 5. The host system
is GNU/Linux i686, and I built m5 for alpha isa. I built full system because
it seems this is robust as well as easy to build according to the document.
I got pre-compiled cross-compiler from m5 website:
http://www.m5sim.org/dist/current/alpha_crosstool.tar.bz2
By using this, I could build most programs in splash2 benchmark suite. (I
referred to http://www.capsl.udel.edu/splash/Download.html )
I think two important steps still left:
  1. inject splash2 binaries into disk image
  2. execute benchmark driver.
It seems m5 comes with scripts for splash2 in that there are run.py and
cluster.py in the configs/splash2/ directory. When I executed run.py, I got
an error.
$ ./build/ALPHA_FS/m5.debug configs/splash2/run.py -n 4 -b Cholesky

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>

  File "configs/splash2/run.py", line 50, in <module>
    class Cholesky(LiveProcess):
NameError: name 'LiveProcess' is not defined
I don't think there is any typo. /dist/splash2/codes exists. Also, I could
run fs.py script by using the following command. I think it means that m5 is
correctly built and directory structure is not incorrect.
  $ ./build/ALPHA_FS/m5.debug configs/example/fs.py
--script=./configs/boot/hello.rcS --timing
As a beginner, it's not easy to find out how to solve this problem. I wish
some gurus help me for this matter.
Another question is how to inject splash2 binaries into disk images. Since I
didn't want to build Linux kernel from scratch, I downloaded disk image from
m5 website, http://www.m5sim.org/dist/current/m5_system_2.0b3.tar.bz2
My plan is to mount that image in the host system, and copy several
binaries. There was no problem in mounting that disk image, but I was
wondering if this is right way to do.
Thanks,
Choonghwan
