When you say "split", do you mean split I/D or split per-CPU?
Also, I'm not sure what you mean by "synchronization": are you talking about coherence?
Finally, please post m5 questions to the m5-users mailing list rather than sending them directly to me.

Hi Steve,
I am trying to understand the way the split cache implementation.
I had one very specific question about m5 1.0. If I want to make the L2
split instead of shared in a multicore situation my question is:
1. Is it sufficient to make a .py file with each cpu having a L1 and L2
cache (ie declare the L2 cache in a similar way to L1) and then replicate
multiple cpus. In this case I will just replicate the L1 to get the L2 and
make one-to-one bus connections between every L1 and L2 and the next level
will be a shared L3 just delared in the same way as L2 is currently.
or
2. Do I need to change the c++ code for synchronization of the split caches?
(ie do something like what is done in m5 2.0)
Thank you,
Forum
