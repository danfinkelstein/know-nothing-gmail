That's great that that will work!  Remember though, if you want to distinguish stats of software threads, you'll have to do additional hacking because stats (like IPC, cache stats, etc) are with respect to hardware contexts only.
 
Good luck!

Hi Veydan,Is it enough to have some unique id belongs to each thread. For example is it enough to use a MiscRegister like IPR_PALtemp23 register value which is unique for each thread.
