Hi all,I've never used M5 before.  I'm trying to learn how to get everything set up.  I have two main things I need to figure out:1) I need to see some example scripts for a multi-core 
CPU (or chip-level multiprocessor, CMP) just to see how things are done and also to get myself started.  Is there a webpage or some kind of resource for more complex scripts than the ones described on the M5 documentation site or the example scripts in the config dir?
2) How to run the simulator on a specific program:  I've looked at the documentation pages (and maybe I didn't look closely enough) but I can't find out where to specify the program to be simulated.  If there's a really step-by-step, thorough tutorial available online that anyone knows of, I'd really like to know about it.
If someone could point me in the right direction I'd really appreciate it.  Thanks,Julian
