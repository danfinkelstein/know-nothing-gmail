Hi Richard,I haven't tried it, but my first guess would be that the process is getting initialized (code & data loaded, stack set up, etc.) and then the checkpoint is coming in and trying to overwrite all that.  This isn't necessarily an error, it's just that the PageTable code isn't prepared for that.  Note that the PageTable class is only used for SE mode (not for FS), so getting an error there is a pretty good sign that no one has done SE-mode checkpoints before.  If you like living on the edge, you could just disable that error and see what happens... in the long run it would probably be best to have some way to suppress the error onloy when loading checkpoints, or something like that.

Hi,
I am trying to get checkpoints working with ALPHA_SE and have run into
some problems. When I try to resume a checkpoint I get a fatal message
in src/mem/page_table.cc:110 fatal("PageTable::allocate: address 0x%x already mapped", vaddr);. It
appears that an address has already been mapped in the page table  Why
would this happen? Has anyone at least tried making checkpoint for a
spec2000 benchmark and resuming it for ALPHA_SE? Perhaps I am running code at the start of the binary after I restore the checkpoint?

I make a checkpoint using:
./build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug  configs/example/se.py  --max_checkpoints=2 
--take_checkpoints="10000,100"  --checkpoint_dir=./checkpoints
I then try to resume a checkpoint with a AtomicSimpleCPU by the command:
$m5-2.0b3*11:57:44=>./build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug  configs/example/se.py  -r 1 --checkpoint_dir=./checkpoints
