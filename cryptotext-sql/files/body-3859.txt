Hi all,
   I added several new directories in /src/mem directory. In each new
directory, I added a SConscript file to declare this new added files.
Also I added new .py config files in /src/python/m5/objects and declare
this .py files in /src/python/SConscript.
   When I did some modification in some files and recompile them, I found
the whole M5 system was compiled! Did I miss something or make some
mistakes?
   Does anyone know what is the problem?
Thanks,
Tracy
