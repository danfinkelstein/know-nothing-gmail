Dear all,
 
I am using m5 for simulation of multiple threads in multicore environment. I wonder if the SE mode can support thread binding just like the thread affinity API does?
For i've checked the archives, which indicate that it can implemented in FS, then how about the SE mode? 
 
thanks in advance, sincerely.
