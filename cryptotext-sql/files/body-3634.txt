> I am looking for something else that could be used to place a load just on the CPU and stress the rest of the node very little. On real nodes I use the complier gcc or g++ to compile a small program continuously. To increase the CPU load I submit multiple instances of this script (using &).
You could do the same in M5

There's not really any porting that needs to be done.  You just need a
gcc alpha compiler.  It may even be on the disk image.  In any case it
should be easy.
If the disk image doesn't work for you, what I've done lately is take
gentoo's stage3 tarball for alpha and put that on a disk image.  It's
got most of what you need on there.  The rest you can cross compile.
(Or compile on a real alpha if you have one.)  I haven't tried it yet,
but I believe that gentoo can do pretty much everything automatically
via cross compile, so if you had an x86 gentoo install, you should be
able to build whatever you want for alpha.  (Maybe when gabe gets some
free time, he can look into that. or when I do.)
