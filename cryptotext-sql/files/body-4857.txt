Hi,
I have installed m5 2.0 successfully. I can run a
multithreaded program on two different cores of a
processor and I can see the results from the
statistics. I want to know how I can figure out which
threads are executing on which core. Can I make
changes in the code somewhere to print the thread ids
that actually got executed on the cores?
Regards-
Chaitali
