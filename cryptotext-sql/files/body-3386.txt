You have to look at the "test.py" file to see what benchmark the regression is running and what input. The "ref" folder refers to a reference for the regression test, not necessarily the "ref" inputs...
Consider you navigate to "tests/long/00.gzip". In that folder you see a "test.py" file.In that file, it says:"m5.AddToPath('../configs/common')from cpu2000 import gzip_log
workload = gzip_log(isa, opsys, 'smred')root.system.cpu.workload = workload.makeLiveProcess()"Thus, you know gzip was run with the small reduced ("smred") input set. Then if you go to the folder
tests/long/00.gzip/ref/alpha/tru64/simple-atomicyou'll see the outputs for the atomic-simple-cpu model for that regression...- Show quoted text -On Fri, Mar 28, 2008 at 7:43 PM, Sujay Phadke <sphadke@eecs.umich.edu> wrote:
Thanks.
But if we run the smred (or other reduced benchmarks), there is no output
directory in the /data/<banchmark>/smred
directory to compare with. I can see the output directory only for the
reference case.
