what's weird is that i just followed the instructions in the website to the letter. i was trying to create the model MyCPU. Could it be that the "tutorial" was wrong, or is this error specific to my installation? thanks a lot!

This is likely because the compiler isn't finding a definition of your CPUclass when it goes to compile the execute functions of the instructions.In the case of the simple cpu, the cpu class itself is used as the context
to pull register values and the like out of, so you're probably looking atsomething similar. I don't know the specifics of that mechanism, but Ithink there's some python code which works through scons to generate a
header which gathers up all the appropriate includes and definitions forall the cpu models you're compiling in. My guess is that that isn't set upright for your new model.Gabe
