Hi
I am new to M5 simulator. I have finished the documents on the web
site couple days ago. However, I could not find the detail about how
to run applications in syscall emulation mode. If I miss anything
important, please give me some hint about it.See configs/example/se.py. 
There is another question if I run a multi-threaded application in
syscall emulation mode. How would M5 deal with the thread scheduling
problem?It doesn't... in SE mode, you can't run a program that creates more threads than there are processors (or SMT thread contexts) to run it on.Steve 
Thanks for any help.
Sincerely,
Dennis Yang
