hi Steve.
thanks for replying, i handled it...i need to add a spm(sram) and define some related operations which can managed by software( it differs from tranditional memory maybe)... so new files named spm.cc and spm.hh are added... i 've fill these into SConsript...(for it's my first time to do that) .
i am grateful for your kindness...have a nice day...

You have to add your new .cc file to src/mem/SConscript to get it tobe compiled and linked into the binary.
That said, you shouldn't have to create a new C++ class at all... ifyou just want to change the latency and the address range you can dothis by overriding the default parameters in python.Steve
