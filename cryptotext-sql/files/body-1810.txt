Hello Ali thanks for the answer, you were right was an M5 bug, I was using a little bit old version of M5 I updated and the error was gone. I was testing DRAMsim and checkpoints and they do not work.By the way does fastforwarding work in FS?.Thanks a lot for the answers.> From: saidi@umich.edu> To: m5-users@m5sim.org> Date: Wed, 18 Feb 2009 22:42:35 -0500> Subject: Re: [m5-users] [PATCH] Beta patch for M5 2.0 DRAMsim implemention- Show quoted text -> > > On Feb 18, 2009, at 9:01 PM, nathan binkert wrote:> > >> Hmm...it is derived from PhysicalMemory, so from that viewpoint all  > >> it> >> needs is to be rebuilt using the same parameters and have the> >> underlying PhysicalMemory data restored correctly.
