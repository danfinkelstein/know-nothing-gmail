 not sure about this.... 
2. parser - 
AttributeError: OptionParser instance has no __call__ method. I think 
it needs input thru STDIN but does not seem to work
 If you are using the script I gave you, it's because you cant have two things with the same class name in one python script.I couldnt figure out how to differentiate the two in python.
The code is something like "parser.options.bmark" but then the benchmark is "parser".What I did was just name derive a new class in my cpu2000 .py file "parser_work" (based off of parser) so to break this and then I could run the program.
 
3. amongst the 
specint benchmarks, perlbmk and bzip2 do not have a smred input set. So what 
input_set options do we have to pass on?
 I used the lgred inputs for bzip2... not sure for perlbmk what I use.. But if you look in cpu2000 where perlbmk is defined you can figure out which input files it accepts...
 
Also, how do we check if the benchmarks ran 
correctly or no?you cna always diff the output versus the regressions outputs in the "tests/long" directory.
 
Has anyone gotten all these to run 
correctly?Right now, I'm running them all on the SimpleCPU. They should work for the O3 too, but I havent tested them all. They probably need to be O3  regression tests for the whole suite on spec2k instead of just a few of the benchmarks.
