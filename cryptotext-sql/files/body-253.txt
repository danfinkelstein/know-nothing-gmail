I managed to make the cross-compiler (4.2.1 now).The m5thread tests compile successfully. But are failing:M5 Simulator SystemCopyright (c) 2001-2008The Regents of The University of MichiganAll Rights Reserved

Thank you. I appreciate your help.One more question: Which values should I use for 'sysrootdir' and 'prefixdir'?Prefixdir is the folder where I want my new compiler.And where should I point the sysrootdir?

Good afternoon, Daniel.
I'm forwarding to you because maybe you can help me.
I'd appreciate your help. I really need to be able to compile the benchmarks.
The message:
Thank you very much.
I am using the Sparc cross-compiler available in the M5 website (version 3.4.5). This happened when I ran make:
Please use gcc 4.2.1+, binutils 2.18+, with glibc 2.3.6 and NPTL or linuxthreads. That's what the code is tested for. You'll have to build your own toolchain, because the one on the M5 website is ancient. I've attached a script that does this automatically, using the debian repositories for some key things. You may have to tweak the script to work since the names of the packages may have changed.
