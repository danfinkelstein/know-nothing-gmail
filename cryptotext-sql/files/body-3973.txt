Hi everyone,
First of all, is there some kind of channel for M5 users on IRC or is
there anyone who would be willing to answer my general-noob questions
on AIM or IRQ or some kind of chat client?  I'm desperate for help,
and though I'm finding lots of high level answers on the website, some
of the walkthroughs on the M5 site go over my head.  Again I'm very
new to M5.
Now to my real questions:
The SPLASH2 Benchmarks page
(http://m5.eecs.umich.edu/wiki/index.php/Splash_benchmarks) there's a
link to an email
(http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.m5.users/1365) that
says that the author does not know of anyone who's tried out of order
CPUS for the pre-compiled splash2 benchmark package provided on the M5
website.  I just wanted to know if anyone in the mailing list has
tried it and knows if it works.
Also, what is a diff. (word seen in
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.m5.users/1365)?
Thanks for any feedback in advance.
Sincerely,
Julian Bui
