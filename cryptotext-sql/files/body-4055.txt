Hi Rick,
I haven't been able to duplicate either of these. Could you send us your
command line?
The first one it's possible you stepped on a bug in the switching code that
is only triggered when the switch happens and a certain event is occurring.
I just tried applu with the smred input set and didn't have a problem. The
second bug I don't understand at all. The getKernelStats() function should
only be called if you're running in FS mode.
