> Which command do I modify to mount it in read/write mode?
You need to remove the copy on write disk image that's in there.
Basically, the disk model connects to the COW image which is layered
on top of the real image.  If you instead just directly connect the
disk model to the real image, writes will hit the disk.
Be warned though, if you terminate the simulation without having the
kernel unmount the image, the image might need a filesystem check or
at worst could get corrupted.
It probably makes the most sense to create an empty image, mount that
directly, and unmount it when you're done.
