Hello,
  I just started using M5. I am trying to compile the beta3. It gives the following output:
scons: Reading SConscript files ...

 using defaults in build_opts/ALPHA_SE
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
It does run thru and build finally, but hy does it not find the options file? Is that required?
It's just a standard notification the first time you build in a new directory... it didn't find any saved build options from the last time you built (since there was no last time), so it's initializing the saved options with the default values.  If this was actually an error it would say "error" or something like that.

Also, I cannot build anything other than the debug. If I try opt on either FS or SE it gives:
scons build/ALPHA_SE/m5.opt

scons: *** Error converting option: CPU_MODELS

It looks like it's having problems reloading the saved options... I'm guessing this is just because it's the second time you've tried to build something, and not anything to do with opt vs debug etc.  What version of scons do you have?  ("scons -v")  I don't see this problem with v0.96.92.
