The closest thing we have to what you're looking for is the Timing CPU model, which models a 1CPI in-order CPU, very basic, but models latencies from the memory system.Any stats you changed/added within the O3 CPU would not be transferred by using the Timing model, but any stats from outside of the CPU (like in the memory system), would still be there.

Hi,
 I have done some changes on O3CPU model of M5 to get different performance-related metrics such as cache misses, register file accesses, etc. at runtme.  I need to run an in-order CPU (similar to Alpha EV4) and get these performance metrics again. 
 I was wondering if I can change the O3CPU model to model an in-order architecture. If this is possible, I will still be able to use my changed code to get performance metrics I need when running the in-order CPU. 
   Has anyone done something similar before?  Thanks   Shervin
