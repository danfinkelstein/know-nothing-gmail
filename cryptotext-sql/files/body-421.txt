I just want my I/O device to run in parallel with CPU. Does the CPUs run over and over? More specifically speaking, CPU may send something to the I/O device to handle, but the time is not fixed. So it is better to let the device keep running and when it receive data ( by the write() function ), it can handle it. I do want the handling invoked within the write() function, I want it to act like a real hardware device. Is there any way I can do this? Thank you very much!

What are you implementing that needs to run over and over so often?
