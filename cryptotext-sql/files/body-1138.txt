Hello,
 
I have some patch for m5-2.0beta5, but this version doesn’t
works with GCC-4.3-2. If anyone has used m5-2.0beta5, can you please tell me
which version of GCC, scons, swig, python would be compatible with m5-2.0beta5.
 Is there any where in m5 repository I can find this information.
 
Thanks & Regards,
-Shiva
