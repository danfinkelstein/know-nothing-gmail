Hello all,
This message is related with this one,
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.m5.users/3939/focus=3967.
In that message Ali gives an explanation about how to use pin. I have
been trying to use it but it seems that  when I am running the script
m5 does not recognize the command, following you can see my script and
the output.
#!/bin/sh
cd /parsec/install/bin
/sbin/m5 pin 0 ./ferret /parsec/install/inputs/ferret/coreld lsh
/parsec/install/inputs/ferret/queriesd 5 5 8
/parsec/install/inputs/ferret/output.txt
echo "Done :D"
/sbin/m5 exit
loading script...
usage: m5 ivlb <interval>
       m5 ivle <interval>
       m5 initparam
       m5 sw99param
       m5 exit [delay]
       m5 resetstats [delay [period]]
       m5 dumpstats [delay [period]]
       m5 dumpresetstats [delay [period]]
       m5 checkpoint [delay [period]]
       m5 readfile
       m5 debugbreak
       m5 switchcpu
All times in nanoseconds!
Done :D
I looked to the code in /util/m5/m5.c and I see that the pin command
is only executed if linux is define. I do not understand why the pin
command is inside those defines. Also I tried to delete the defines
but that did not work. Any help about how to use it?.
Thanks a lot in advance.
