Are you talking about the -i option?  That's to set standard in for the process, and there is no support for passing in multiple files.  You could simply cat all of your input files into one big file and then use that. If you're trying to do somethign else and actually use file open from your process, you don't need to do anything in the configuration other than make sure your current working directory is set right.

in the example/se.py script i just see an example on how to open 1 file.  i
have tried a couple of ways but none of them would work right

i am trying to write an script for syscall emulation m5 and i am unable

any examples that i can look at or can someone tell me how to load it
into the process?
thanks paul
M5 emulates the open system call, so if your program tries to open a file
for input, it should work.
