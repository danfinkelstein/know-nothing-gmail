For example if you look at configs/common/Caches.py an L1 and L2 cache are defined. They both inherit from the BaseCache and set a default latency, associativity, etc. If you wanted to make the L2 cache special you could can just add a parameter to the cache overall and then set that parameter in the L2 cache class (or make your own cache class) e.g.:
class L2CacheWReplacement(L2Cache):
    different_replacement = True
Any time you use L2CacheWReplacement in the object hierarchy the different_replacement parameter will be set and the cache model can change it's behavior based on that parameter.

There are unique names for each object, but I'd say that hacking
things to be based on name in the C++ code is a bad idea.  It is
certainly error prone.  Adding a new cache type or a flag is easy
enough.

Isn't there unique ids assigned to all components (buses+cpus+caches), so one can use different functions on objects base on their ids?

If you want to use two different replacement functions, you'll either
have to create a flag parameter to select one or the other or create a
new cache class.
In either case, the caches themselves don't know if they're L1 or L2
caches.  What you'd do is go into your configuration script and create
the caches with different parameters or classes when you add the L1s
vs. when you add the L2(s).

Hi all,
  I want to implement a cache replacement arithmetic. If I want to use this
replacement arithmetic only in
L2 cache, how can I differentiate L1 and L2 cache? For example, if I change
the findReplacement() function
in Lru.cc, it will also be used in L1 cache. How can I avoid this situation,
and use this new function only
in L2 cache?
  Is there something used to identify L1 and L2 cache, such as some member
variable in cache class? How can
I get some change only in L2 cache?
  Thanks a lot!
