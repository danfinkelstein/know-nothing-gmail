Hi, all, I am using M5 ALPHA fs mode to run splash2. I compiled the splash2 programs (CHOLESKY) myself and copied to the ramdisk to boot the linux. Typically a splash2 program take several minutes to several dozens of minutes to finish. But for this one, CHOLESKY, it never ends. Several hours later, the M5 kept output the following: 
warn: could not read byte from debuggerI run M5 under fast mode and did not use gdb. Why does the M5 output such a sentence? I found that it is in base/remote_gdb.cc, but I can not figure out why the M5 goes into here. It is really wired. By the way, when I run CHOLESKY in 4 threads mode, it is OK. But when the thread number becomes 16 or 32, it never ends. Could anyone give me some hints about this problem? Thank you very much!
Best regards,
