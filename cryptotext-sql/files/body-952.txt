Hello,
I am trying to display thread ID using pkt->req->threadid(), however
the following occurs in FS Mode:
int Request::threadId() const: Assertion
`privateFlags.isSet(VALID_THREAD_ID)' failed.
However this is not my question, my question is why is there not a
function for thread id like this one:
 bool
    hasContextId() const
    {
        return privateFlags.isSet(VALID_CONTEXT_ID);
    }
am I missing something? Implementing one is trivial,  I am wondering
if I am using this function incorrectly (pkt->req->threadid())
Thanks,
EF
