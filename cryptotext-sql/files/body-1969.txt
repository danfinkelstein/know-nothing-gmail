Hi all:
 I am trying to run Spec OMP in the APLHA_SE mode. I used the
pre-compiled cross-compile to compile the code of Spec OMP. When I
compile the code without -fopenmp flag, the code is not parallelized,
and the m5 simulator can execute them normally. However, When I
compile the code with -fopenmp flag, the compilation has no error, but
the m5 simulator would say "fatal: syscall set_tid_address (#411)
unimplemented." I have also tested a test program such as hello world.
It shows the same behavior. It seems that m5 can not execute the
compiled openmp code. How can I solve this problem?
Thanks in advance
 sitos
