Hi,
I need the stats from both the private and the shared cache to be from
exactly the same instruction mix (thread interleaving). If I where to
compare the two separate runs that wouldn't be the case as the
increased number of misses in the shared cache will have an impact on
execution speed resulting in a different interleaving.
I realise that I'm trying to do something that is not straightforward,
I was wondering if it seems feasible to implement... Perhaps it would
be more feasible to make the caches thread-aware (tagging the blocks
with a contextId) and keep everything internally in one single cache.
Regards,
