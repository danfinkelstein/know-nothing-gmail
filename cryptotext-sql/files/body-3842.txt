1)I really need to know the link bandwidth, so I can calculate
 how much time to transmit certain amount of data.
 If it's a gigabit link, why are those rxBandwidths and
 totBandwidths just tens of bits per second? I looked through
 the source code etherlink.cc, does the link bandwidth equal
 sim_freq/ticksPerByte?
This is the bandwidth your application achieved.  For example, think of a real gigabit ethernet link.  Usually, you're not actually sending 1Gbps on that link.
2)Is the execution time on testsys equal to
  (drivesys.cpu.numCycles/2GHZ)? In M5 simulator,
 does 2G mean 2*2^30 or 2*10^9?
For bytes, G is 2^30, for everything else, it's 10^9- Show quoted text -
