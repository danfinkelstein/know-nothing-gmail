Hi Meng-Ju thanks for your help, it's really appreciable I'm starting these days my work with the M5 simulator and with all of this answer I can advance much faster. Now I can run my own tests, but my problem is that in the output of the simulation (the file m5stats.txt), there is nothing, where I can get the performance results. Thanks.- Show quoted text -
