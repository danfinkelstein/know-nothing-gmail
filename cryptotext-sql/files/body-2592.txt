Thanks for your response. I do not use any share cache. In my
configuration, each processor has private L1 and private L2 cache. Then
I want to find which pages are accessed by processor 1 or processor 2. In this case, can you give me some ideas?- Show quoted text -On Fri, Aug 29, 2008 at 10:54 PM, nathan binkert <nate@binkert.org> wrote:
We don't currently record that information.  It would take a bit of
effort to add that information.  The biggest issue is if you have any
shared caches, it's hard to even decide which main memory access was
for what.  Do you want any shared cache?  Do you only want L2 miss (or
last level cache miss) data and not all accesses?  If you want all
accesses, you could hack that in pretty easily.
