Hi all,I am a new user of M5. When I try to build any architecture (even default) i get the following error:TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'str'  File [srcdir]/m5-stable/SConstruct, line 335:
     env[ 'GCC' ] = subprocess.Popen(env[ 'CXX' ] + ' --version', shell=True,System:cpu: Intel Core2 DuoOS: Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy)Steps already taken:1) All compile pre-requirements met: g++ (4.2.4), Python (2.5.2), scons (1.2.0), SWIG (1.3.33), zlib & m4
2) Tried $CXX=g++ , $CXX=/usr/bin3) which g++ = /usr/bin/g++4) Downloaded using Mercurial (hg clone)5) ran hg fetch to see if any "patch" or update was available. It said everything up to date.
I read a few threads already talking about this but none went past the point of making sure g++ and/or m4 was already installed.One thread suggested downloading a patch:From: Ali Saidi <saidi <at> umich.edu>
Subject: Re: G++ INSTALLED but scons not compiling m5????
Newsgroups: gmane.comp.emulators.m5.usersDate: 2008-09-23 19:18:42 GMT (25 weeks, 4 days, 11 hours and 9 minutes ago)Try to apply the patch that Nate committed to the development  
repository (id 26231e06f86d). That should fix your problem.AliMy questions are:1) How do I download this patch? Is it with Mercurial? 2) Do I need to manually download all patches or do they come with the lastest repository version?
4) When I download patches; how do I merge with my current download?3) Is there a definitive answer to this problem? I appreciate anyone helping out. I will be using M5 for course project and research projects so I really need to get it up an running :). 
Best regards,Javier Malavé
