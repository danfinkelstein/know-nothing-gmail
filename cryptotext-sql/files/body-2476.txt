Hello M5 users,
The M5 team would like to announce that we're releasing the 6th beta for
M5 2.0, and that the m5-stable repository has been updated to this beta.
Both the development repository and the stable repository can be
accessed from our download page,
http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Download. While we strongly
encourage accessing the repositories as a mercurial repository, a
tarball of the current version of the stable repository is available
here: http://repo.m5sim.org/m5-stable/archive/tip.tar.bz2. There are
many improvements throughout m5, including the following:
New Features
1. Support for gcc 4.3
2. Core m5 code in libm5 for integration with other simulators
3. Preliminary support for X86 SE mode
4. Additional system calls emulated
5. m5term updated to work on OS X
6. Ability to disable listen sockets
7. Event queue performance improvements and rewrite
8. Better errors for unconnected memory ports
Bug fixes
1. ALPHA_SE O3 perlbmk benchmark
2. Translation bug where O3 could fetch from uncachable memory
3. Many minor bugs
We're getting close to a full 2.0 release which should happen after the
following issues are dealt with:
1. Statistics cleanup
2. Improve regression system
3. Testing
4. Validation
Gabe
