Hi,
As Steve said, M5 provides point-to-point link, but switch
model is needed to hook up more than two systems. So my
question is: Can I have several systems(> 2) work together
with each two having a distinct point-to-point link for data
transfer? It is somehow like a fully-connected network. In this
way, is switch model still needed? Thanks.
Xin
