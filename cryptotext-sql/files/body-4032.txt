At a high level, this makes perfect sense.  The details are the killer
though; this is not a simple task.  We had a student over the summer
working on parallelization in a shared-memory environment; he made a
lot of progress but nothing ready to integrate into a release.  Doing
it on a cluster would be much harder as you would have to package all
the needed state in messages, where m5 currently assumes that passing
pointers to shared objects works fine.
