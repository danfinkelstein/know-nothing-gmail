Hi all,
I'm simulating a single core LinuxAlphaSystem with the bitcount
benchmark from Mibench. The configuration script I used is exactly the
same as configs/example/fs.py. The command I used is as follows:
m5.opt fs.py -b bitcount --caches --l2cache -t
After the simulatin finished succesfully, I noticed the total number of
cache misses in the level 1 caches, i.e., both L1 instruction cache and
L1 data cache, is slightly larger than the total number of accesses to
the L2 cache. Intuitively, these two numbers should be the same, right?
Is there anything that I'm missing here?
Thank you,
--Xi
