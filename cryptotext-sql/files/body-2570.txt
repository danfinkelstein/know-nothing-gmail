I’m trying to add extra symbols to the symbol table M5
uses internally from user code using the m5_addsymbol() pseudo-instruction. 
So far my attempts have not worked, user code is still being labeled at
__bss_start.
 
To add the symbols I’m using the wrapper functions
provided by m5op.h.
 
Here is a snippet of what I’m doing in the main
function of the benchmark I’m using:
 
…
m5_addsymbol(&xactionAbort, “xactionAbort”);
m5_addsymbol(&xactioinBackoff, “xactionBackoff);
…
 
Will m5_addsymbol work for user code? Or will I have to
modify M5 to work with user code symbols?
 
Thanks,
Geoff
