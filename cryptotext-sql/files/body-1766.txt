Hi all,
I have been trying to compile 2.6.18 linux kernel on my Athlon 4200
using the alpha cross compiler available at
http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Download. This results in a kernel
panic on boot. I have also used Nate'ss cross compiler and have built my
own compiler from www.kegel.com/crosstool, which all result in a kernel
panic. So at this point, I am wondering if there is some AMD problem, as
the crosscompiler works on intel machines that I can use. Has anyone
else noticed this?
Best,
-Rick
