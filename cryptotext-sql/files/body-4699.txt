Have you mounted the disk image and verified that /sbin/init exists? Is hda actually your disk image and not some other disk image that doesn't have an init on it?

Greetings all,
Thanks for your help.
Ali mentioned initially building on real hardware but unfortunately I don't have access to an alpha... :-(
As far as Lisa's questions are concerned, they are inline below.
Looking forward to getting to the bottom of this!

if it's something that came directly from busybox, it should play nice, but

The most astonishing thing is literally the ONLY change in the ptxconfig is adding env...
it would be helpful to see some stats and data.
When you ask for stats, do you also mean the m5stats.txt file?  I've put it here temporarily just in case:

1) what kernel headers are you compiling against in linux-dist?
When I made my crosstool, my dat file looked like this:
BINUTILS_DIR=binutils-2.15
GCC_DIR=gcc-3.4.3
GLIBC_DIR=glibc-2.3.5
LINUX_DIR=linux-2.6.13
LINUX_SANITIZED_HEADER_DIR=linux-libc-headers-2.6.12.0
GLIBCTHREADS_FILENAME=glibc-linuxthreads-2.3.5
I set "Path to linux kernel src for headers" to the m5base-2.6.13 directory and set my toolchain to the crosstool installed with the above dat file.
2) what kernel have you compiled?
The panic happens both with the distributed vmlinux (inside linux-dist.tgz) and also with a kernel I build (where I added SCTP to be compiled into m5base-2.6.13.tar.bz2).
3) most importantly, what are your error messages?
The final lines from the console are:
...
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 480k freed
Kernel panic: No init found.  Try passing init= option to kernel.
Thanks for you help.  Please let me know if you need anything else,

Greetings,
I've been having a series of problems that I was hoping to get some help
on.  Long story short, when I build disk images and add ONLY Shell &
Console Tools->BusyBox->Coreutils->env after cloning, the resulting image
causes the kernel to panic, and I don't understand why...  I have been
able to build and boot disks using the same method successfully.
The reason I wish to add env is because when I ran my series of
applications, it complained that it didn't exist. So, there is this issue
of "why did the kernel panic?" but more generally, I seek advice for how
to add in my own applications the proper way.  I'm guessing you have
experience with this seeing as how you have so many advanced benchmarks
available within the default system.  Is there a list/person where I
write to ask about your experiences of getting complex applications to run
inside m5?  Is this the right list to ask such questions?
Thanks!
brad
