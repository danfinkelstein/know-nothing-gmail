Hi all,
I am trying to study the performance impact of off-chip bandwidth
contention on CMP. Currently, I only use the number of L2 misses,
because the L2 miss goes off-chip. But I have no clear idea about how
to relate the off-chip bandwidth limitations with L2 misses. Are
memdepunit.memDep.conflictingLoads and
memdepunit.memDep.conflictingStores good metrics to use?
Thanks
Meng-Ju
