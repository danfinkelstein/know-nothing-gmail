hi,I am trying to solve the problem but can't... Where to change 12 ?... please specify the file name where this values (opcode latency of square root) is stored .thank you,

 From my experience, this error implies that the simulation has no event
to schedule and rapidly proceeds to its simulation limit (maxtick)
without anything to do. I have encountered this problem when the opcode
latency of square root is set too high (24 cycles) on OOO cpu model. You
might try reducing sqrt root latency to 12. If that doesn't work, I
suggest comparing the debug output of Exec for a system using all atomic
cpus and a system using all O3 (or timing depending on what you used for
your simulation).
Best,
