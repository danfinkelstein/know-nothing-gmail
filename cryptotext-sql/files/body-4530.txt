Hello,
  I just started using M5. I am trying to compile the beta3. It gives the following output:
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
Checking for C header file Python.h... (cached) yes
Checking for main() in C library python2.5... (cached) yes
Checking for accept(0,0,0) in C++ library None... (cached) yes

 using defaults in build_opts/ALPHA_SE
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
It does run thru and build finally, but hy does it not find the options file? Is that required?
Also, I cannot build anything other than the debug. If I try opt on either FS or SE it gives:
scons build/ALPHA_SE/m5.opt

Hey Ron,
Thank you so much! This helps me a lot and establishes further my
confidence
in M5 :) COOL!
Radix did finish executing, despite the warnings, I just want to
make sure
that the system call is handled (maybe a bit confused by the
printing that
says "ignoring system call ..."). I'm curious about what kind of
system
calls is ignored.
I'm excited about configs/splash2, but I cannot find it in m5-2.0b3
directory after I unpack the tar ball... Is it in this released
version?
Please see the email discussion with Edith Hand
about the Splash2 benchmarks for patches that make the Splash2
benchmarks
work and a config file that is up to date
Sorry about another dummy's question: where can I find this
discussion? (I
just subscribed to the m5 user mailing list...)
There on the M5 website to two services which archive all the mails
on this mailing list.
Ali
Thank you so much!

Thanks Gabe! So Alpha is the choice at this time.
But I'm still fuzzy on the CMP simulation with M5.
1. is it possible to simulate a CMP under SE mode? If so, do you
have any
example scripts on configuring the CMP architecture? (in configs/
example,
se.py has only one SimpleCPU configured)
Yes it is possible to simulate a CMP in SE mode.  It is easy to
simulate a
multiprogrammed workload where each core is running it's own
process.  If
you want a configuration that supports a multi-threaded program you
will
need to modify things to handle it.  If you are looking to use
pthreads I
would suggest moving to FS mode.  As for an example config there
isn't one
in the release tree.  You could look at the configs in the configs/
splash2
directory and modify it to assign each CPU it's own workload.
2. Since I have to run threads on this configuration with SE mode,
I will
need to implement some thread creation/termination primitives in the
simulator. There might be other primitives as well. This may involve:
adding more ops to the ISA, adding a load balancer unit to the
simulator
that creates threads (allocate stack size, set per-thread stack
pointers,
passing thread contexts). Would you please give some hints on how to
implement these in M5?
You could look at the way we implemented the Splash2 benchmarks in
SE mode
for an example, but again it might be easier to move to FS mode for
multi-threaded workloads. Please see the email discussion with
Edith Hand
about the Splash2 benchmarks for patches that make the Splash2
benchmarks
work and a config file that is up to date.
3. How Flexible is the memory system? In se.py, private L1 caches are
specified, and I saw in BaseCPU.py that a private L2 cache can
also be
added, but what if I want to have private L1 caches for each core
and a
shared L2 cache?
It is flexible enough to instantiate a private L1 and a shared L2
cache.
See the configs/splash2/run.py file for how that is set up properly.
4. How fast is M5? How many instructions can M5 run in one second on
average?
This depends greatly on the configuration.  It runs faster if you use
atomic mode and ignore the timing.  If you are using the simpleCPU
it will
simulate faster than the O3 CPU.  I don;t have numbers around
regarding
how common configs will run or how the number of Cores changes those
values.  Perhaps someone else in the group has some recent data on the
simulation rates of common configs.
5. Why the test case radix doesn't work under ALPHA_SE, and
instead it
prints out:
warn: loadGlobalSymbols: bad symbol header magic on
tests/test-progs/radix/bin/radix
warn: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...
warn: ignoring syscall sigprocmask(3, 18446744073709551615, ...)
warn: ignoring syscall sigprocmask(3, 0, ...)
warn: ignoring syscall sigaction(8, 4831387552, ...)
warn: ignoring syscall sigaction(11, 4831387552, ...)
warn: ignoring syscall sigaction(10, 4831387552, ...)
warn: ignoring syscall sigaction(4, 4831387552, ...)
warn: ignoring syscall sigaction(7, 4831387552, ...)
warn: ignoring syscall sigaction(6, 4831387552, ...)
warn: ignoring syscall sigaction(12, 4831387552, ...)
warn: ignoring syscall sigaction(5, 4831387552, ...)
warn: ignoring syscall sigaction(13, 4831387552, ...)
This isn't broken.  It is just a warning that gets printed out, but
doesn't cause incorrect behavior of the code.  Does anything print out
after this that indacates a failure?  Perhaps a abort, segfault,
panic,
...
Thanks!
Jiayuan
Hope that helps clarify things a little further,
-Ron

on test
code compilation
   One thing I noticed is that you said you compiled your binaries
on a
SunOS
machine. SPARC SE only supports Linux binaries at the moment, so
you'll
need
to
recompile. Also, SPARC support is not totally production ready
right now,
so
you
could quite possibly run into problems which are not your fault.
If you
need
something that's very likely to work, I would recommend using
Alpha. If
you
decide to use SPARC, please let us know of any bugs you might find
and/or
fix.

Thanks a lot Steve!
I am trying to model a CMP architecture. I think at this stage, I
will
not
model OS. I would prefer to run with syscall emulation mode. So I
have
two
following questions:
1. is it possible to simulate a CMP under SE mode? If so, do you
have any
example scripts on configuring the CMP architecture? (in configs/
example,
se.py has only one SimpleCPU configured)
2. Since I have to run threads on this configuration with SE
mode, I will
need to implement some thread creation/termination primitives in the
simulator. There might be other primitives as well. This may
involve:
adding
more ops to the ISA, adding a load balancer unit to the simulator
that

passing
thread contexts). Would you please give some hints on how to

these
in M5?

M5 can run pthreads binaries in full-system mode, which means you're
restricted to Alpha for now.
There are directions on building a gcc-based cross compiler here:
http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Using_linux-
dist_to_Create_Disk_Images_a
nd_Kernels_for_M5
Note that you just need to follow the first section (on building the
cross compiler); the other parts on building a new kernel are
unnecessary if you're just compiling new applications.

Hi all,
I am a starter on M5, and I'm interested in simulating a

program on a CMP architecture. My question is, can M5 run programs
written with pthreads? what crosscompiler do you recommend to
compile C
or C++ code on a x86 host to SPARC/ALPHA binaries that can be
run on M5?
I tried to compile helloworld code on UltraSparc IIIi/SunOS
using gcc
version 3.3.6. However, the sparc binary generates faults when
the code
is run on M5. Would you please give me some hints?
Thanks!
