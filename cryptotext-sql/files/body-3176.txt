I was running multiple programs in SE mode. My simulation got stuck, and one
thing I found was that the parameter "until" for Bus::occupyBus() was not
increasing. I continued to suspend to watch that value and to resume the
application again and again, but the "until" parameter stopped increasing
after 1???????? (Sorry, I forgot the number.)
Since I modified some parts of Bus class, I'm not sure if this problem is
originated from m5; but, it seems this problem exists in m5 2.0 beta 5
because I observed the same problem by using m5 2.0 beta5 with patches Steve
posted in the mailing list.
It's hard to get any clues because it is not always deterministic. The only
thing I am quite sure is that this problem happens only when --detailed is
used.
Thanks,
