I figured that but on the crosstools website they build everything with 2.6.12.

That just means that you want the toolchain to reflect the same headers as the kernel you want to build for M5.  So, if for M5 you want to use kernel 2.6.22, then you should build your toolchain with those headers so they won't be incompatible when you actually build the kernel, so no need to go back to 2.6.13 if you are running 2.6.22, you're in luck!

The wiki says the following:
"Modify the gcc-3.4.3-glibc-2.3.5.dat so that the linux version it
points to reflects the Linux headers you want to use in your toolchain.
Currently in M5 we are using linux-2.6.13, so you should set it
accordingly."
When running the demo-alpha.sh script, it looks for the headers tarball
in the $TARBALLS_DIR.
Thanks for your help!

Where do we say you need the 2.6.13 headers? It's been a couple of
months since I used crosstools, but if I remember correctly it grabs
all the files it needs to compile and you shouldn't have to get
anything manually.
