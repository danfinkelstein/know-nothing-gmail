1) On a multiprocessor system, when a upgradeReq hits the global bus, the owner sends a UpgradeResp and all sharers invalidate their copy. The invalidation by sharers and UpgradeResp happens as a single transaction?
2) I observe some WriteReq packets on the global bus. on a Write miss ina last-level cache, does not the cache make a ReqReq packet and send it over the global bus. Are the WriteReq packets possibly from the I/O subsystem?
3) In the presence of UpgradeReq and UpgradeResp, why are the commands WriteInvalidateReq and WriteInvalidateResp needed in packt.hh?
Thanks.
