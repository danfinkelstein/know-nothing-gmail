Hi Nate:
    Thank you for your comment. So, does that also mean that if I
include any of the file in the m5/src/ directory in the EXTRAS=foo/bar
file, I need to specify that file in the path that is relative to the
foo/bar directory?
Let's say that I have my foo/bar file in /home and m5/src is also in
home. So the path is
/home/m5/src
/home/foo/bar
    For all my files in the foo/bar directory to include a simple.hh
file in the m5/src directory, I need to specify that
#include "../m5/src/simple.hh"
    Is that right?
    Thanks again for your comment.
Regards
James Wang
