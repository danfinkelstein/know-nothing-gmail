Hello,
 
I am having problems with getting m5threads to work with OpenMP
codes. All of my multithreaded codes build and compile with m5thread library
correctly, but only OpenMP codes do not seem to run in multithreaded mode. Also,
all tests included in the m5thread package pass except for the OpenMP one. I
would appreciate any help.
 
Lukasz
