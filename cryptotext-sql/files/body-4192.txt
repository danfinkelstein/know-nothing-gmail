Hi Rosa,There are a couple of issues with this script and that is the reason you're not seeing the extra disk.1. The disk controller only has two ports and each support a master and a slave, so you're new disk would need to be a slave:    self.disk3 = CowIdeDisk(driveID='slave)2. You never added the new disk to the list of disks the controller owns. Near the top of FSConfig.py something like this:        ide = IdeController(disks=[Parent.disk0, Parent.disk2],should be changed to:        ide = IdeController(disks=[Parent.disk0, Parent.disk3, Parent.disk2],3. You'll need to actually mount the disk using an rcS file or manually at the command line, as it won't get mounted automatically.  So you'll ned to execute something like mount /dev/hdX1 /z. Depending on your exact configuration X will be a,b,c, or d. AliOn Oct 7, 2007, at 8:29 PM, Rosa Ree Reese wrote:hi, i'm an M5 and Python newbie.
