HI, Nate, could you give some more specific hints on how to implement an extra structure in M5 and get it accessd from user code ? The major problem may be the address allocation, how can I make this structure accessed by an address range that I designated myself ? How does M5 open an address range to the linux and to the application ? Thank you!

In general, things that work in Linux should work in M5 FS mode.  We
actually run the linux kernel, so you get what it gives you.
