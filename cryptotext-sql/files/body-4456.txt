Hi Steve,
   I appreciate you very much for your reply. I had tried the --trace-flags="Exec" and got a very big file which was nearly 9GB. I thought it was the statistics instruction by instruction.And I searched the file by the keyword "thread" and I got the information like this:
   61912087000: system.cpu0 T0 : @kernel_thread : ldah       r29,79(r27)     : IntAlu :  D=0xfffffc0000801c70
                                                            ...
   2026704706000: system.cpu3 T0 : @start_thread+36 : ret        (r26)           : IntAlu :
Is that possible that I can use such an information to help me understand when each thread starts and ends.
            Thank you very much for your help and best wishes to you!
                                                                               Yue  Li
                                                                              07-05-2007
