Hi all,
Currently, I am working on something like "Coroutines". The basic idea
is when I have a L2 miss, then I will jump to other functions. Now, I
am using the simple timing CPU model and CMP configuration. My
question is  how could I pass the L2 miss information to the
corresponding CPU. For example, If the CPU0 needs to read the data and
there is a l2 miss, then how could the CPU0 know this?
Thanks for your help,
Meng-Ju
