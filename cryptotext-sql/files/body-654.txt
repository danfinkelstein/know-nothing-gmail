The file released should have a build.log or another log that has all those details.- Show quoted text -On Tue, Dec 1, 2009 at 10:24 AM, Joel Hestness <hestness@cs.utexas.edu> wrote:
- Show quoted text -Hi,  On UTCS systems, we have always had trouble using the precompiled crosscompilers on the M5 site, as we have run into issues with directory structure or host system architecture.  However, we have been able to build our own crosscompilers using crosstool to get by.  We noticed that the M5 site has gcc-4.3.2 available in the downloads section, but we were hoping to get more information about the build, so that we can replicate it.  Can someone let us know which versions of glibc, binutils, linux headers and patches were used to build each of the crosscompilers?
