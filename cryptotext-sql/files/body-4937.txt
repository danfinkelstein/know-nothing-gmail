Getting the deadlock message at cycle 0 basically means that the CPU never really started executing instructions.  One common cause for this is that your programs are not statically linked; see http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Frequently_Asked_Questions#I_compiled_an_executable_to_run_in_syscall_emulation_mode_but_it_doesn.27t_work.
You should verify that both programs run successfully by themselves before trying to run them both together.
BTW, specifying two programs in a list like you have there is specifying two programs for a two-way multithreaded CPU, not for two different cores.

Hi All,
I am trying to run two independent workloads -
"HelloWorld" and "MatrixMultiplication" in two
different cores. I am using m5 1.1 version. I have
written a run.py file similar to the run.py file given
in m5-tests/test3/ i.e. "BaseCPU.workload = [ Benchmarks.AnagramLongCP(),Benchmarks.GCCLongCP() ]"
But the simulator is returning an error saying
"Deadlock.. Simulation terminated at cycle 100000".
My programs are single-threaded applications. Is this
the reason for the error ?
Can anyone tell me what I should do to make it run
successfully.
Regards-
Rajdeep
