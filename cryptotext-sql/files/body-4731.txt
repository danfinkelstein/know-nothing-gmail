Hi all,
    I find two virtual to physical address translation functions in M5:
    One is translate() defined in AlphaITB/AlphaDTB class in tlb.cc,
    the other one is vtophys() defined in vtophys.cc.
    Does anyone know which one is for simulated virtual address to
simulated physical address translation? And which on is for simulated
virutal address to host physical address translation?
    Thanks!
Tracy
