Hi,
Got a quick question about the stats package.
Is the DRAM stats turned off by default in m5?
I saw in src/mem/dram.hh files, there are stats such as
    Stats::Vector accesses;
    Stats::Vector bytesRequested;
    Stats::Vector bytesSent;
    Stats::Vector compressedAccesses;
In the dram.cc files, the formulas to calculate them are not there.
Is it true the m5 simply don't dump dram stats at all? Where is the
switch to turn the DRAM statistics reporting on.
Or it is because dram.cc stats implementation is not complete?
thanks for the help in advance.
john
