Hello,
I'm somewhat new to m5 and I've a question regarding trace_cpu.cc in
/src/cpu/trace/ . What exactly is the purpose of this code? Can this
be used to generate traces, or can it use traces as an input?
On a more general note, is it possible to do a trace-based simulation
in m5? If so, what's the procedure to do that?
Thanks,
Felix
