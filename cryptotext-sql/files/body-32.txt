Could it be that in the InOrderCPU, all mshr accesses are misses? But
only for the dcache.
I have over a hundred traces of programs that have executed more than
140 million instructions all showing the same thing:
overall_mshr_hits=0.
The overal_misses of the dcache equals overall_mshr_misses of the
dcache.
If it would help I could send my config-file.
This entry in the config-file says that I do have mshrs for the dcache:
[system.cpu.dcache]
.....
mshrs=10
.....
Regards,

  The
number of memory writes will be more difficult to calculate: it equals
[number of evicted cache lines that were written] plus [number of data
cache WriteReq_misses].
  
  Check the stats for "MSHR" misses there (and corresponding code
if you want to know when that gets updated). Y
  
You could technically have a miss to the same block that a MSHR is
handling, so that "miss" is kind of being double-serviced so to speak.
