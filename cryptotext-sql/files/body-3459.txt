Hi Ali,
Thank you very much for your reply. I have some problems when I write
two benchmarks into one rcS file. I use the following file to boot the
two core system, but found that only the benchmark bzip is executed.
#!/bin/sh
cd /benchmarks/spec2000/CINT2000/256.bzip2
./exe/bzip2_base.gcc33-high-opt ./data/ref/input/input.graphic
cd /benchmarks/spec2000/CFP2000/172.mgrid/
/sbin/m5 loadsymbol
/sbin/m5 resetstats
./exe/mgrid_base.gcc33-high-opt<./data/ref/input/mgrid.in
/sbin/m5 exit
I wonder if you could tell me how to write it right. Is there any way
like making LiveProcess in the SE mode. Thank you very much！
Look forward to your reply.
Best regards,
Lei Shi
