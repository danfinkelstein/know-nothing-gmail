Hi all,
 
I want to print some statistics of physical memory in the m5stats.txt file. Following the example in dram.cc and dram.hh, I first add " virtual void regStats();" function as a public member and " Stats::Formula bandwidth;" as a protected member of MemoryPort class where I want to get the statistics. The body of regStats() in 
physical.cc file is as follows:
 
void PhysicalMemory::MemoryPort::regStats(){
 
        using namespace Stats;
        bandwidth
        .name(name()+".bandwidth")
        .desc("bandwidth of memory")
        ;
        bandwidth = data_bus_cycle*5000/curTick; //data_bus_cycle is a variable defined by myself
 
        }
 
However,  there is no bandwidth information in the m5stats.txt. I think maybe the function regStats is never called but I do not know how to call it, or is there anything wrong with what I have done? Could anybody help me?
 
Thank you very much!
 
Jun Pang
