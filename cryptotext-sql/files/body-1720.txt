There is no simple system for disabling statistics output.  The
easiest thing to do is to probably just run a script to prune it down
after the file is generated and then delete the file.
If you want to hack the code, the "print" flag on the statistic could
be cleared for all stats by commenting out the line in the name()
function that sets that flag.  You could then manually call
"mystat.flags(print)" for all of those stats that you actually want to
see.
