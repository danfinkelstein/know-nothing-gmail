Hi Sujay,Another question, which I think has been asked before, but I cant find an
example. Can I do this by writing a function which would just print out thestats for me in the format I like. I would have to have this function calledat the end of simulation. How do I do this?
I asked a similar question a while back.  Ali and Nate suggested using the registerExitCallback functionality, which allows you to register a function to be called at the end of simulation.  This worked well for me - the function gets called after simulation gets finished, but before stats are printed (so I was able to update stats values based on the state at the end of simulation).
