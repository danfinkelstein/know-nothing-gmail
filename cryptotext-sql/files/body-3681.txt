I just clean-installed Ubuntu 7.10 (got fed up with the state of
Debian) and mostly things worked OK with a clean install of M5 2.0b4
but I patched the wiki with a few details I had to fix:
* needs m4 macro processor (not in the default Ubuntu install)
* looks like Ubuntu needs zlib1g-dev instead of zlib1g-dev
* the instructions to untar the FS files puts them a directory too deep
   (unless you edit configs/common/SysPaths.py)
Just a heads-up in case I unintentionally did something weird in my
Ubuntu install and these don't apply generally ...
