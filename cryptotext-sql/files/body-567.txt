In simics, we can use Haps to register a callback function, when some
events happen, we can run our own codes to do something. Can we do this in
m5?
To be more specific, I want to simulate until some point, like a function
call, then stop and do something. It seems now that I can only stop at some
instruction count, but in practice we don't know at what instruction count
an event will happen.
