Hi Steve ,I am working on prefetching techniques and trying to
get the miss rate for ghb, stride and tagged. I am making the required changes as per mentioned in the repository "Fixes to get prefetching
working again" and "Update stats for new prefetching fixes"Â  to make the prediction work. But in-between I
have trouble(s) regarding the files mentioned in the reposiory and the files
present in M5_2.0b6 such as the file "/src/mem/request.hh". The changes for the file provided in the repository is different from the file present in the
M5_2.0b6. Its so confusing with whether I have to make changes to existing files in M5_2.0b6 or to replace the whole file. There are many such files and is really creating trouble to make the changes in M5_2.0b6. So can you please share with me your updated M5_2.0b6 so that I can have it as reference and can concentrate on prediction techniques rather than how to make M5 run.....
Please reply as my research work got suck on this point. Hoping kind cooperation.Thanks in advance Ashutosh Jain
