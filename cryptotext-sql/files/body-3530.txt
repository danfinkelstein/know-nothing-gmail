I am doing a multicore simulation and I only want to measure cache misses during the guest application's parallel phaseI added two systemcalls which tells m5 to start measure and stop messure, the system calls will be called by the guest application when it reaches its parallel phase. I can get around it by using my own variables. But  I LOVE m5 and I would prefer to use its stats if possible.It's a pity that the functionality is turned off. Is there a patch for it?Thanks!Jiayuan> Date: Mon, 4 Feb 2008 13:35:56 -0800> From: nate@binkert.org> To: m5-users@m5sim.org> Subject: Re: [m5-users] stats switch off/on- Show quoted text -> > Actually, M5 used to support this sort of thing, but nobody really> used it, so the code was removed to simplify the statistics.
