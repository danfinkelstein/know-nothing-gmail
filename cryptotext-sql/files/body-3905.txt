1.
I have a system with four processors. I make four LiveProcess objects and assign the radix benchmark to each of them. After a while, I get the error, segmentation fault, core dumped. Any insight?
2.
I want to assign one process to one of the processors in above system and want others to be idle. But then it says, parameter workload not specified. Any way around?
