Hi all,
I want to do some research on the subject of SDRAM fairness of
multicore and need to make all the threads reach the same max
instructions. How could I do this with M5? If I set
max_insts_any_thread the same for all the threads, then when one of
them reaches the max_insts_any_thread, the simulation will stop.
Please help me with this.
Thank you very much!
Jun
