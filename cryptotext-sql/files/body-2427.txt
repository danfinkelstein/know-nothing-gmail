Hi:I have to change the policy that the simulator uses to access to the cache. And I got several questions for example if there are three cores that want to acces to the shared cache, what policy is used?, hit first, round robin..., where is the code of that policy?, and finally is it possible do this or it's a very complex task?.
Thank you so much for answer to all my questions, you guys do an excellent job with this mail list, thanks.
