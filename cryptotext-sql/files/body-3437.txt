i'm down with this.  m5-out or m5_out are cool with me.  not m5.out - that seems like it would be a file rather than a dir.lisaOn Wed, Mar 19, 2008 at 2:39 PM, nathan binkert <nate@binkert.org> wrote:

I just randomly picked it.  Add "m5out" to the list? Any other
opinions?  While I'm at it, should I change any other default names?
Maybe:
m5stats.txt -> stats
config.ini -> config
console.foo.sim_console -> foo.console
None of this is required.  Just if I'm going to change one default and
there is a desire to change others, doing all at once would probably
be a good idea.
