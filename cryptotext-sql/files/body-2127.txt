Hello,
Exploring the statistics genreated for the simulator, I do not
understand the difference between this two outputs:
system.l2.overall_accesses                        482
     # number of overall (read+write) accesses
system.l2.demand_accesses                         482
     # number of demand (read+write) accesses
What is the difference between overall and demand, can anyone please
clarify me this?, thank you.
