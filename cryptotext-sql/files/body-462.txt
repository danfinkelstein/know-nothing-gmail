  
  
Hi All,
I am successfully able to run m5 in ALPHA_FS Mode and connected with it using m5term on 3456.
However, I stopped the m5 simulation in the terminal by sending terminating signal to the runing process using <Ctrl>+C 
and I got a message 
"hack:be nice to actually delete the event here"
Please can anyone let me know if this is the correct way of stop the simulator and there is some other way I should do it.
Regards,
