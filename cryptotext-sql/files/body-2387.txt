Bus port IDs are assigned as the connections to the bus are processed,
which happens in a fairly arbitrary order... so yes, I can believe
that seemingly minor changes to your configuration would affect the
bus ID assignments.
I don't see how this could cause a problem though... your whole
discussion of src and dest fields being the same is confusing to me.
If the src and dest fields are the same then a device is sending a
message to itself.  This only happens in one scenario that I know of,
which is when a cache broadcasts a request up the hierarchy to force
an invalidation (e.g., an L2 broadcasts a request from the L2-L3 bus
up to the L1-L2 bus)... since it is a request, the lower level cache
is the implicit destination, even though it's also the source.  I
think there's some explicit code in the bus that deals with this.
Other than that, I don't believe you should ever see packets where src
== dest (hence the assertion).  If you're talking about IDs across
different buses, then that's a bug; the src & dest fields on a packet
should be using IDs that are relative to the bus the packet is being
sent on.  If a packet is transferred from one bus to another then the
src field should get rewritten to reflect the new sender on the second
bus.  (Note that this happens implicitly in the bus port code.)

However, if the order of declaration of buses is changed, the port ids somehow change, and the assertion failure no more and thus messages are received by nodes who earlier sent them, because src and dest are different. Now, one should be careful about final destination port being same as beginning (src) port, but hte order of declaration changing the bus port-ids look suspicious?
