Well, I have also ran a profiler and it seems like sorting the
statistics takes up most of the time spent before simulation starts. The
function Stats::StatData::less(), which compares two StatDatas, is the
main time consumer. Especially the tokenize() function on each
StatsData.name takes time.
I should probably save the tokenized version of the name and not recompute it every time.
It looks like less() does unneccessary work: it splits up the
hierarchical name at the "." (using tokenize()) and then compares the
token lists component-wise.
IMHO, a simple string compare of both StatsData.name should yeild the
same result w/o taking the strings apart. Thus, one could simplify
Stats::StatData::less():
It's not quite the same result.  If I don't take them apart, then a.b would come before ab.  The idea was that names further down in the hierarchy should come later in the sorted order than things higher up.
I guess if it's a big performance issue, we can change things, but I'd first like to see if just saving the tokenized form of the name helps.
