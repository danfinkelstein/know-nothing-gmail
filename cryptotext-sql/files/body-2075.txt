Hello I have several questions about the latencies in the class
DRAMMemory of the file PhysicalMemory.py, I have seen the definition
of the following parameters:
    act_lat = Param.Latency("5ns", "RAS to CAS delay")
    cas_lat = Param.Latency("5ns", "CAS delay")
    war_lat = Param.Latency("7.5ns", "write after read delay")
    pre_lat = Param.Latency("18ns", "precharge delay")
    dpl_lat = Param.Latency("7.5ns", "data in to precharge delay")
    trc_lat = Param.Latency("57.5ns", "row cycle delay")
My problem is that I do not identify this parameters with the common
timing parameters that I can get from memory manufacturers, such as,
CL-tRCD-tRP-tRAS-.
I know that act_lat is tRCD, and cas_lat is CL, but can anyone please
tell me what parameters are the rest tRPand tRAS?.
Also I have checked the file dram.cc and in there I can see the timing
parameters that I want, is a good idea change the parameters in the
#defines and recompile?.
And another question to use the class DRAMMemory instead of
PhysicalMemory, do I need to go to the file FSConfig.py and change the
line
    self.physmem = PhysicalMemory(range = AddrRange(mdesc.mem()),
latency='180ns') to
    self.physmem = DRAMMemory()
And finally where can I specify the size of the memory using the class
DRAMMemory in Full System mode?. I have not seen any range parameter.
Thanks in advance for the help.
