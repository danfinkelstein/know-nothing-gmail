Hi Ashutosh,Can you tell at which point the SPEC CPU 2000 benchmarks are failing under 2.0? Do you see any output at all (like a default m5stats.txt file) or console output? Also, what is your file structure for the CPU 2000 binaries and input/output files and what changes, if any, have you made to the test.py file you use to run the simulation?Finally, I assume you're running SE, not FS? And are you simulating Alpha?--Dan- Show quoted text -On Mar 7, 2008, at 17:06 , Ashutosh Jain wrote:- Show quoted text -hi,   I am graduate student pursuing Masters in Computer Science and currently want to do research work in computer architecture, So my professor told me to learn M5 2.0b4 version simulator.............I got familiar with M5 1.1 very much and i already run SPEC cpu2000 on that and i am unable to run SPEC cpu2000 benchmarks on M5 2.0b4...............   Please help.......     Hoping to hear very soon..........   Thanks Ashutosh JainM.S.
