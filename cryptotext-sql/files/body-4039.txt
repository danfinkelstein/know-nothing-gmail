HI,
      It works with Stats::Value and using the functor in the regStats declaration. However, I have another problem. I want to have an array of floating point metrics, and I want to print them out at the end. One way is to name the various stats with a "_<index>", and print out n of those, but its messy. Is there a way I can use a vector stat and use this "value" type in order to have floating point in it?
Another question, which I think has been asked before, but I cant find an example. Can I do this by writing a function which would just print out the stats for me in the format I like. I would have to have this function called at the end of simulation. How do I do this?

First, please keep your questions to the list and not to me directly for everyone else's benefit.
Another follow up to my previous mail:
I tried using a static variable (float), doing all calculations with it. Now I want to dump the value of this at the end, so I tried assigning it to oa Formula stat so that it is printed out at the end.
Stats:: Formula energy;
in the regStats,
energy = static_variable;
Problem is this stat is not being printed at all. Any ideas?
If you don't at least give a stat a name (using the .name() function), it won't print.
