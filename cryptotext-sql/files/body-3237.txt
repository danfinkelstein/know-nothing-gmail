So it did work with a smaller dataset? Two possibilities arise:
1) There is a bug. Either with the way we allocate memory or some how we're emulating mmap wrong. It's not impossible, but I think it's pretty unlikely.
2) The benchmark needs that much memory. I found the following:
Memory SPEC CPU2006 requirements to memory have grown significantly: the typical memory size is 1 GB for 32-bit systems, exclusive of OS/overhead, but more may be required. Typically, 64-bit environments will require 2GB for some of the benchmarks in the suite. More memory will be needed if you run multi-copy SPECrates: generally 1GB for 32-bit, or 2GB for 64-bit, for each copy you plan to run.
So it very well may require > 2GB of memory for that dataset.
Also, the nominal run time listed for bwave with the normal input set is ~1.25 hours. Given the extreme slow-down of simulation, it would be nearly impossible to simulate the normal input set.- Show quoted text -
