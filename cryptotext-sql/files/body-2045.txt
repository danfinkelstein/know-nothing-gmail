Hello Ali thanks for your answer, what is the difference between
"commit.COM:count # Number of instructions committed" and "num_insts #
Number of instructions executed"?
And also if commit.COM:count  is the number of instructions executed
for the CPU, They are ver disproportioned in my simulation, my results
of commit.COM:count are:
CPU0: 500k
CPU1: 8k
CPU2: 8k
CPU3: 300k
Is this a problem of the Simulator or it just depend of my workload?.
And also I have a question regarding the host_seconds ,  is this the
time that the simulation have been running in the host?, in my stats
it says that is 85 seconds, that is a number very low compare to the
hours that the simulation have been running.
