i am running FFM from the splash2 benchs and i am following the cache and the bus traces.
I am using two processors and the L1 caches are connected to the shared bus with the memory. I have configured the system for only atomic type of accesses. In the traces i cannot see the second cache and at sometimes i am getting functional access on the bus. How is this possible?
