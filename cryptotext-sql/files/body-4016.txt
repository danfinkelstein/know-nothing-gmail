Hey Rick,
you need the set the parameters for the O3CPU inside the se.py file or
whatever file you are using to configure the simulation.
But say you are using se.py, then you need to configure the O3CPU once
the O3CPU is instantiated.
Around line 63 in se.py there is a line that sets up the CPU model:
(CPUClass, test_mem_mode, FutureClass) = Simulation.setCPUClass(options)
The O3CPU is only valid if you selected the 'detailed' option on the
command line so after that line 63, you could edit the file with
something like this:
if options.detailed:
        CPUclass.smtNumFetchingThreads = 2
        CPUclass.smtFetchPolicy = "branch"
        ....
The different options for fetch policy, lsq policy, and commit policy
can be found in those implementation files (e.g. fetch_impl.hh,
lsq_impl.hh, commit_impl.hh, etc.), although they should probably be
outlined somewhere in the O3CPU.py for easy use.
Hope that helps!
Korey.
