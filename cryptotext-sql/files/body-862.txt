Hello di,
 
This a wattch.diff file provided to me by Rick Strong (from M5
user list). This do not work with 2.0beta6 or latest version of M5. This is
supposed to work with beta5 but I tried integrating with the older version
(which requires a lower version of gcc). But still I had some issue.
 
Thanks & Regards,
-Shiva

Hi All,
I am looking for an integrated version of M5 and Wattch. I believe some people
have done that already. Is there anyone willing to share that version or
his/her ways to integrate these two tools?
Thank you very much,
di
