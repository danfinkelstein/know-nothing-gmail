Hi,
I am trying to run the Splash2 in Chip MultiProcessors using SE mode.
I get the Splash2 binary in the following link.
http://www.m5sim.org/dist/m5_benchmarks/v1-splash-alpha.tgz
I can run SPLASH2 in Simple 4 CPU cores
using default .py file (m5_1.1/m5/configs/splash2/run.py)
But Simulation isn't finished  in Detailed 4 CPU cores.
Could you tell me how to run Splash2 benchmarks ?
following line is my comand line message and m5stat.txt
##### comand line messege ######
