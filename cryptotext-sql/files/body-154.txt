I'm pretty sure there isn't any way to do that with the code as is. After Googling a little, it looks like you could use the PARSEC hooks to run a new M5 pseudo instruction that turned on or off tracing. There are probably other ways to do that, although I expect you'll have to write some code no matter what.

of PARSEC applications. But how can i let M5 only DPRINT information of ROI.
Thanks,
Sheng
