Hi,
Is there any good method of scheduling a thread between CPUs? I am trying open two threads from a checkpoint and put them into a SMT processor. What would be the best way to proceed. I could imagine scheduling them from a single core to a SMT core, or just finding a way to schedule them together at the beginning. Any ideas?
