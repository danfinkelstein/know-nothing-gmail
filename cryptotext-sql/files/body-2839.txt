Hi , when i try to run 8 core with each having 8 threads each in it ,
 
gives me different error :
Global frequency set at 1000000000000 ticks per secondfatal: numThreads is not a valid value @ cycle 0[DefaultFetch:build/ALPHA_SE/cpu/o3/fetch_impl.hh, line 132]Memory Usage: 2204368 KBytes
 
May i know reason for this  ,it says numThreads is not valid value ??? 
It works fine when i run with 8 core and 2 threads each , but when i increase threads it shows error...
Regards,
Ravi Prakash

As the error message indicates, it's coming from the eio code.  Thelimitation is on the number of simultaneously open EIO traces.  The
error message also tells you how to fix it.Does this mean you got past the error you were having previously wherethe second thread never seemed to commit any instructions?  If so, canyou let us know what the problem was in case others run into it?
