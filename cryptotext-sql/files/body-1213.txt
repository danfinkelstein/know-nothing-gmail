Hello all,
I want to track physical register accesses in a single core of an
ultrasparc/opensparc T1 (which has SMT support for 4 h/w threads, each
of which is allocated a quarter of the physical register file).
It appears that the way to model this in m5 is to:
1. Instantiate one master physical register file with the total integer
registers (and , perhaps, even floating point registers) required for
all the 4 threads. Assert statements in cpu.cc suggest that.
assert(params->numPhysIntRegs   >= numThreads * TheISA::NumIntRegs);
assert(params->numPhysFloatRegs >= numThreads * TheISA::NumFloatRegs);
2. The current rename logic doesn't seem to track the actual
mapping between the physical register file and the isa register file
across the h/w threads. If that is correct, the rename logic should be
modified so that register renaming for each thread
takes place to physically separate portions of the master physical
register file.
Could someone comment on my understanding above.
regards,
Soumyaroop.
