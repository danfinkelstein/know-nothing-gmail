So the obvious is that you're actually reached the tick that you
wanted to simulate to. Assuming the limit is the max 64bit int, then
the reason is that the cpu is stalled waiting for a response that
never showed up. Have you made changes to m5? If you're making changes
to the memory system you need to be very careful to not loose
requests. You might also want to use the memtester CPU to debug your
changes.
