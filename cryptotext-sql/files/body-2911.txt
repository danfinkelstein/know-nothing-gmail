you could try reading the technical report "Quantifying the Complexity
of Superscalar Procesors" by Parcerisa et al. Their main focus was the
delay but they also factored in area so I guess that may be a possible
starting point.

If anyone knows of methodology or some research regarding this, please give suggestions.
