Meng-Ju et al.,
Following your suggestion I worked worth Meng and was able to, with the
author's help, able to get it working.
In the meantime I have developed doubts on your suggested direction.
Problem restatement: in the early 1990s authors showed that by having
some information on the location of a task's footprint in cache the
scheduler could make better decisions reducing the cache reload
transient.
What I wonder if by using threads I am undermining the results.
Speculatively, I could have four identical cores, three polluters and
one core that (pollutes then loads; loads then reloads; etc). A problem
is that this isn't a full context switch so I suspect that the
footprint shall not be very discrete and thus harder to show.
It seems feasible that this could be accomplished by running the system
in FS, however, that could incur quite large penalties to run.
I (and my advisers) have investigated a sundry of ways to make this
work, such as: checkpointing and trying various restarts; and, the
method you suggested.
The checkpointing seems most able to show what we want but from my
reading of the code it isn't going to work without some modification.
The least pleasant alternative is to abuse the code and actually do
context switches then have the simulator be the Omni-scheduler.
Thoughts?
In some respects I need an Omnipotent/ Omniscient scheduler.
