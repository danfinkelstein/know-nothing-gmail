1.
Whenever, the packet intersects the bus and the command is WriteReq, recvFunctional() is called which carries no latency with it. Why this is so?

Does the command WriteReqNoAck|Writeback means an L2 write miss and the packet is broadcasted so all caches can update their value for that address and ultimate write back to memory.
