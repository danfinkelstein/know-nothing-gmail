As a more general concept, would it not be a useful concept to start
building a "contributions" collection? I see quite a lot of questions
on the list along the lines of I am trying to simulate configuration X
where X is a slight variation on what others may be doing.
Benefits:
* in the interests of science, better repeatability (someone claiming to have a
  better idea than published work can actually use it directly -- and check the
  results)
* fewer questions like the above on the list
Costs:
* extra maintenance, possible to mitigate by making it clear that
  "contributions" are not maintained, and the original author
  should be asked questions on details
