It's likely that you're trying to simulate a system that has more memory than
your computer and/or your computers address space supports. If you're using a
32 bit host, you could try moving to a 64 bit one. If that doesn't work, you'll
likely have three choices.
1. Scale back your simulation. M5 executes for what would be a short amount of
real time, so you likely couldn't even touch very large regions of memory in
any reasonable amount of time.
2. Buy more RAM and use a 64 bit computer.
3. Implement a memory object that can be sparsely populated. If you do this one,
please share after you're done.
