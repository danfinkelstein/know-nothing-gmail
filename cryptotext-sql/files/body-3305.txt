Thanks for the help. I'll use this patch as well as add some variability to
my L2 misses and L1 misses, since I have the feeling most of my workloads
can probably fit inside the caches I'm using for experiments.

Subject: Re: [m5-users] Inducing non-determinism into multiprocessor setups
in M5
Actually in our tutorial as ASPLOS 2008 we showed an example of adding a
variance to delay memory. Here is a diff to m5 that should do the trick.
Just set latency_var = 'XXns' on the Physical Memory object and that should
do the trick. It will still be deterministic for a given latency since the
random number generator is seeded to the same thing (which is good so you
can redo an experiment when you find the problem). Changing the latency_var
parameter by a little bit is probably the best way to see a wide variety of
results.
