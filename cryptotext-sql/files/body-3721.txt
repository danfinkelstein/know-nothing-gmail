    Likely what is happening is the m5 process is running out of file
descriptors. If you expect your simulation to need to open a lot of
them, you could try to push up that limit. I don't remember exactly how
that's done off hand, but I'm pretty sure you need administrative
privileges to do that normally. It could also be that your simulation is
going berserk and opening a ton of files when it shouldn't, although
that's not likely since it looks like it hasn't done anything yet.
