I created a MyCPU.py, but I placed it in m5/src/python/m5/objects, since all
the other Python object files are in there(03CPU.py,, OzoneCPU.py, etc).
There is not even a directory names "objects" under m5/src/python, the
folders under it are m5 and swig. At first I thought this was just an
oversight on the part of the tutorial writers, but could this be the
culprit?
This makes me think that you're using beta4 and that the tutorial hasn't been updated for it.  In beta4, you put the .py file wherever your .cc or .hh files are.  You also have to add it to the SConscript file with a SimObject() call
Also, the way Korey mentioned adding the new CPU object isn't the same in beta4.  There is a SConsopts file where the new CPU model options are added to the build system.
Grep for SimpleCPU in all files in the src/cpu/simple directory and you'll see what I'm talking about.
I'm honestly not sure that either issue would manifest itself with your error message.  If these things are the problem, would you be willing to fix the tutorial on the wiki?  If not, can you tar up your whole directory (except for the build directory, please don't include that), stick it somewhere and send a URL?  If you don't have a webserver that you can put it on, you can send me the tarball in a private mail.
Thanks,
  Nate
