I was reading the document and a doubt creeped up my mind. Do m5 support multiple levels of private caches. For instance , multiple processors each having private L1 and private L2 caches.

Everytime the packet occupies the bus, if SNOOP_COMMIT bit is set, snooping by other caches is initiated, otherwise not. A packet is not exclusively sent to initiate snooping by other ports. Is it right?
