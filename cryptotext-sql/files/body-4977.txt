I agree it sounds like you're not specifying the correct benchmark
command line. Good references can be found at:
http://www.cag.lcs.mit.edu/~kbarr/cag/spec2000-commandlines.html
and
http://www.cag.lcs.mit.edu/~kbarr/cag/spec2000fp-commandlines.html
I've written some Python classes which encapsulate each of the
SPEC2000 benchmarks. They were designed for m5 v1 so might need a few
changes for m5 v2. You can find them at:

>From what I remember, it makes local copies of the input files from one
read-only root. This is a little space inefficient but avoided having to
have long paths in the command lines.
