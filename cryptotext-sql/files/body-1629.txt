Is there an easy way for me to swap out tasks between cores or if not
could someone point me in the direction I need to implement it?
Weeks ago I tried searching the lists for all the information I need,
it seems the mailing list was-is corrupted.
I am studying 'cache reload transients'. I am seeking ways to pollute
the cache in a CMP with with footprints from other core's tasks and
context switches; then measure the reload times for loading the
appropriate cache footprint.
I believe that the M5 simulator has no built-in scheduler, meaning that
without running in FS mode that the system can only use one task at
time per core.  However, since there is a FS mode then it can be done.
Using Checkpointing/Serialize_UnSerialize I suspect N tasks should be
able to be swapped, but I have a limited understanding of the memory
internals of this simulator, even though I have perused quite deeply
into the code.
I see the following functions in cpu/simple/atomic.cc, I believe these
facilities are available for what I would do:
        resume ()
        void    switchOut ()
        void    takeOverFrom (BaseCPU *oldCPU)
        virtual void    activateContext (int thread_num, int delay)
        virtual void    suspendContext (int thread_num)
So ultimately my question is: Is there an easy way for me to swap out
tasks between cores or if not could someone point me in the direction I
need to implement it?
Thanks,
Will
