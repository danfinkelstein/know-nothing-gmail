i want to add something to my question about sram, since i want to add the sram which is unified in memory address space but seperated in layout(sram is on-chip but dram is off-chip)...i can't derive it from cache since there is no tag...so i am puzzled, can i derive it from PhysicalMemory ? what else should i do then?
