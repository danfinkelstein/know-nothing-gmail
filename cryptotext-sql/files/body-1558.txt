You'll need to be much more specific.  If you're getting a segfault in m5 itself, we'll need a stack bactrace from gdb to have any idea what the problem might be.Steve- Show quoted text -On Wed, Apr 22, 2009 at 1:30 PM, Pavan Kumar <jorrigal@gmail.com> wrote:
- Show quoted text -hi,          I am running SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks on M5-2.0b6, it
was worked fine. Recently, i updated all the updates on my m5 from m5
repository. Now, when i am running simulation on M5, it is showing segmentation fault for all the benchmarks.          I am using your Mybench.py and cmp.py files from this website (http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/SPEC2006_benchmarks). it worked fine before, after updating it is giving the above error.
