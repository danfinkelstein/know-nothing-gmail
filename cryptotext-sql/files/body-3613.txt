I think you're wrong on point 2... max_insts_all_threads runs each
thread for *at least* the specified number, and does not terminate
individual threads early.  There's no option right now that does
terminate individual threads without terminating the entire
simulation, largely because in my opinion that's kind of meaningless
(for the reasons you explain in point 2).
I can take a crack at updating the FAQ later if you don't get to it.

Overall I think our FAQ is way too big and should be reorganized into
normal topical documentation, but this particular question isn't any
worse than any other.
