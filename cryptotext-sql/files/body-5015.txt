I think that kevin may be on to something, it may be because in 1.1 stats were not reset between the 1e9 period and the 200e6 period.  I believe that they are now reset.- Show quoted text -
What changes did you make to the ethernet dev file?  If you only get 2k packets, maybe it's only during the 200e6 period that it's actually running (the 1e9 period is much longer).  If you can figure out when packets stop transmitting, you can try using the various Ethernet trace flags (see base/traceflags.py) to try to track what's going wrong with the Ethernet device by outputting a trace around that time.  To start tracing at a specific cycle, add "--Trace.start=<cycle num>" to the command line, and use "--Root.max_tick=<max cycle num>" to limit your simulation length.
I hope this helps,
Kevin

Hi all,
 I'm using M5_1.1 version. Under original condition, when I'm running netperf-maerts benchmark, and do the sampling with 'Sampler(periods = [1e9, 200e6])', it always gives me about 67k packets transmitted during this period. However, after I modified the ethernet dev file a little bit, it only gave me about 2k packets transmitted, and there is almost no statistics in the output file. It seems like nothing is excuting during the 200e6 cycles. How to figure out this problem?
 Thanks,
Yu
