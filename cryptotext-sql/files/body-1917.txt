You need to implement gettimeofday(). Implementations exist for
AlphaLinux and Tru64. Replacing the unimplementedFunc in the syscall
table with the appropriate one should do the trick.

Maybe same as above. You would need to figure out what it's calling
ioctl on.

I'm aware of no programs that intentionally take an fp fault for
correct behavior, but I could be wrong.

Implement the for instruction in src/arch/sparc/isa

If you're going to work on getting these fixed, please use the
development repository http://repo.m5sim.org/m5 and PLEASE contribute
the changes back when you are done.
Thanks,
