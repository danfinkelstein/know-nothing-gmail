Suppose I have multiple L2 caches connected via shared bus and a single shared L3. Also a load miss in one of L2s is served by another L2 (cache-to-cache transfer). How/when is the L3 informed regarding  the cache-to-cache transfer? Is it accessed simultaneously and later inhibited after some time?
