> (1) I think there is no member variable in the enum CacheBlkStatusBits type that signify the owned state of the MOESI cache coherence.
The status bits don't individually correspond to coherence states.
Assuming BlkValid and BlkReadable are set, the states are encoded like
this:
Dirty Writable  State
  0         0          S
  0         1          E
  1         0          O
  1         1          M

I updated the wiki to clarify this:
