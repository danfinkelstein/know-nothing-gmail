hi all,
 I am trying to run 26 benchmark simulations on a single core processor
using M5. The following problem crops up.
fatal: out of lex buffer streams, increase MAX_STREAMS@cycle 0
[yy_setstream:/z/stever/bk/m5/eio/exolex.l
Memory Usage: 1530048 KBytes
I have tried increasing MAX_STREAMS from 32 to nearly 300 in the
configuration file, but still the problem persists. I would appreciate any
suggestions that may lead to the solution to this problem.
Thanking you all,
