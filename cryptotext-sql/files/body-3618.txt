I will provide the relevant information in a p2p email.
I tried setting the activity parameter to 1 and meet the same problem.

Hi Rick,
There may be an issue with the CPU thinking there's no activity left due to the long latency of the instruction, and then not waking up properly when the instruction completes.  I'm not sure why it'd be on that instruction in particular though.  I'm going to try your example and see if I can get some more information about why it might be doing this.  This may take me some time as I don't have a clean up to date tree at the moment.  Could you send me your exact command line, as well as any diffs on any of the configuration files you made?
In the meantime, try this: in your configuration file where you select the O3CPU (most likely Simulation.py if you're just using our default configs), try setting the parameter "activity" to 1.  This should (hopefully) prevent the O3CPU from going to sleep if it's inactive.  If the program runs properly as a result, then this is most likely the culprit.  You may get very minor statistics differences if you set this to 1.

Hi all,
I have been tracking down a problem with resuming a few benchmarks which include (fma3d, ammp, apsi, mgrid, and others) at certain checkpoints. The culprit appears to be a sqrtt (FloatSqrt) operation that gets stuck at the head of the queue and stalls the detailed model (O3CPU). If I run the benchmark in AtomicSimpleCPU there is no problem.  I have confirmed that sqrtt is at the head of the queue in four samples (two in ammp and two in apsi). The simulation ends with ("Exiting @ cycle 9223372036854775807 because simulate() limit reached.") . The same symptoms are seen in other benchmarks suffering a similar phenomena and I guess that sqrtt may also be the culprit. If anyone has some insight on what might be happening, it would be appreciated.
