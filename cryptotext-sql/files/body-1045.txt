I don't know that the inorder-timing CPU has received any performance
tuning. There maybe some simple fixes that improve performance. If you're
motivated (or waiting for your simulation to complete), compile a m5.prof
and run 10 minutes of o3 and inorder and compare the profiles. There might
be something glaringly in there or at least if you share the top 15 of each
we might be able to point you in the correct direction.
