I was wondering if there was a patch missing.  I'll have to check if I
forgot to commit something.

Because none of use use it, so it's harder to ensure that people are
happy.  I'm content to make 2.6.18 the default.  I'm not so confident
with 2.6.22 not having slowness hiccups, but it has worked fine for me
in the past.
