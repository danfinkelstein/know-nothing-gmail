It can be caused by several things: a bug in the memory system
(unlikely in this case), a bug in the load/store queue (possible, but
not completely likely),  a bug in the dependence tracking in the CPU
(probably the most likely), or ???? (maybe Kevin could create an
exhaustive list). The way to find the problem is to compare an
execution trace of the O3 cpu with the AtomicSimpleCPU. They should
commit the same instructions with the same values and read/write the
same data from memory. The execution trace is generated at commit, so
if that is the same you would have to start looking the current state
in the CPU at the time of the problem.
If you find a bug please let us know,
Ali
