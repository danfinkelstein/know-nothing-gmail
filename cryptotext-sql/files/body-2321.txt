Hello all,I'm trying to abstract the simulated O3 cpu in m5 (2.0b5). I couldn't understand the following that seems to be happening in rename:For simplicity, let us consider the case where there is only one thread.
In rename_impl.hh, at the end of cycle i, we have  instsInProgress (cycle i ) += [(renamedInsts (cycle i ) - fromIEW->iewInfo.dispatched(cycle i-1)]; /* fromIEW.dispatched is the sampled value at the beginning of cycle i, so it will have the value at the end of cycle i-1, whereas the number of instructions renamed at cycle i is not buffered */
When computing the number of free ROB entries [function calcFreeROBEntries()], the formula   num_free = freeEntries.robEntries - instsInProgress + fromIEW->iewInfo.dispatched    [a]is used.So the first time calcFreeROBEntries is called in a cycle, all variables will have sampled values from last cycle.
My doubt is, why is fromIEW->iewInfo.dispatched added to num_free, in formula [a]? We don't really free any ROB entry after dispatch, right? We only free an entry after commit (which anyway will be accounted for, when ROB is updated during commit). 
And why do we subtract instsInProgress from num_free? [Is it because the instructions renamed at last cycle wouldn't be accounted for yet?]Could anyone please help me understand, and tell me where I'm wrong?
Thank you very much!Best Regards,Arun
