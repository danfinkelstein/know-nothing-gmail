Hi all,
After executing a subset of MiBench I received this exit cause for a few benchmarks:
Exiting @ cycle 9223372036854775807 because simulate() limit reached
CRC32 and gsm encode with the large input set are the two benchmarks that cause this message.
On the mailing list I read that this happens due to deadlocking for example.
However, I run this code on a single InOrderCPU and I don't see where CRC could possibly deadlock. Besides, it executes correctly on the Atomic CPU.
Does anybody have ideas about possible causes? Or did anybody ran CRC32/gsm encode large on the InOrderCPU to completeness?
Regards,
Max
