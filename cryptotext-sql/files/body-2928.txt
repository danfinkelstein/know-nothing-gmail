Hi Shoaib,
I actually had forgotten about the script you sent me, sorry... your
email reminded me of it so I went back but I cannot reproduce your
problem.  I had to modify the scripts to get them to work; I'll send
you the modifications separately and see if they still fail for you.
If I can reproduce the problem, I will definitely track it down and fix it.
Steve

For one benchmark, the problem disappears after I increased the MSHR queue size for L3 cache. I never dig myself deeper into debugging the execution traces but I do believe there is a problem. Also, I had this problem for some media benchmarks, I guess epic and gsm, while others (jpeg,mpeg etc) worked fine.
