Yea you will, but we are working on fixing it. What version of Scons do you have installed? (scons --version).
Thanks,

Gabe, Ali:
Gabe, your suggestion of rerunning SCONS worked well....the compilation
completed after rerunning SCONS twice. Will this have to be done for every
architecture/mode I try to compile if I dont create the symlinks manually?
Thanks for your prompt help guys.
Quoting Gabriel Michael Black <gblack@eecs.umich.edu>:
    If you don't want to try to create the symlinks manually, you can
alternatively rerun scons a few extra times. Each time you run it, it
will get one file farther until it gets through all of them and
continues. You shouldn't have a problem after that unless the symlinks
are deleted somehow. Like Ali said, please let us know if that doesn't
fix your problem.

Sometimes we've seen a problem where scons doesn't properly create
symlinks from build/ALPHA_FS/python/*.i -> src/python/swig/*.i Could
you try to create these and let us know if that fixes your problem.

Hi,
After updating the SWIG version on the server I keep getting this
error when I
try to compile:
scons: *** [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'build/ALPHA_FS/python/swig/debug.i'
scons: building terminated because of errors.
The correct versions of SCONS and SWIG are installed. What is causing
this
error?
