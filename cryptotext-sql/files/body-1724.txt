Hi, Korey, thanks for your reply. Do you mean that every class should have a create() function that return to the type xxxParams ?I  want to implement RaceCache as something like Physicamem, so if I inheriet it from Phycisalmem, will it work ? Do I have to add
an extra create function ?can you please tell me briefly what the xxxParams is ? I have seen the kind of things in many place but I can't understand how it works. Thank you !

Did this class derive from BaseCache?
If so, then you are probably creating a new "SimObject" which gets
instantiated via the swig-python(?)/Params interface.
Look in src/mem/cache/builder.cc.
In there, you'll see a BaseCache "create()" function that is used to create
a cache object with the typical M5 params.
Somewhere, you are going to need a "create() function for you SimObject if
you intend to be able to instantiate it through a config file.
