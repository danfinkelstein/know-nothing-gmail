Don't use init at all.  Use a kernel command line option
(boot_osflags) to change init to your own shell script.  Something
like "init=/m5/bin/init.sh".  Also, if we're going to create a new
tarball to share, I'd like to suggest that we work on getting my new
m5ops into the tree.  They extend /bin/m5 to have a readfile command
that takes a parameter, so you can read different files.  Those files
are just python objects, and the objects can actually be any python
file object, so you can wrap strings in your config file and such.
I can send you my patches if you'd like to check it out.

I actually stole my stuff from an install of gentoo, but that's not
strictly necessary.  The install helped because I was able to emerge a
few packages that aren't in the stage3 tarball.  I do believe that we
should be able to figure out a crosscompile solution for this.
Alternatively, I do have an alpha up at HP that's outside the firewall
that you can use.

I think we want to deprecate linux-dist and move everyone to gentoo.
I'm willing to help build a new image, but I don't want to do it
alone.  I've hesitated before, because I'd like to move *everything*
to the new image, tests, documentation, etc.
