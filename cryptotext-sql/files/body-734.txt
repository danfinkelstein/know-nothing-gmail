Hi ,   I find out that my MPI does not with well with the cross compiler. THe binary mpicc produced is not a target alpha one, but a x86 one. I am working back on rebuilding the mpi. HOwever it seems that MPICH does not support cross compiler....
Just wondering waht to do now. -- - Show quoted text -************************************************Gu Junli--谷俊丽PHD Candidate of Tsinghua UniversityBeijing 100084,ChinaTel: 86-10-62795139
