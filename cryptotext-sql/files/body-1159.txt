Hi Nate,
It still gives me the same message. I tried 4.2.2 (which is created in Jan
2007 and 2.0b5 is created in Feb 07) and 4.1.3.
Now I am trying to move to 2.0b6. I have a query here:
In 2.0b5 version, in cpu_builder.cc file. This returns a cpu
DerivO3CPU(params) with params which is of AlphaSimpleParams type.
This object do not exist in 2.0b6 version, I want to know how do you pass
parameters like these to the cpu in 2.0b6 version.
    params->BTBEntries = BTBEntries;
    params->BTBTagSize = BTBTagSize;
    params->RASSize = RASSize;
    params->LQEntries = LQEntries;
    params->SQEntries = SQEntries;
    params->SSITSize = SSITSize;
    params->LFSTSize = LFSTSize;
Also I could not find this file which is included in cpu_builder.cc file
#include "params/DerivO3CPU.hh"
Could you please tell me where do I find this file?
Thanks & Regards,
-Shiva

I'm guessing 4.2 would work.  I'd say that if you want to be sure,
find out what the latest version of gcc was when we created 2.0b5 and
use that.
