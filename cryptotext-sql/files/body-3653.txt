Where can I find the possible command line options for the benchmark applications, for instance:
./spec-m5 1 20 1 192.168.0.1 5 40000 1000000000 1000 , taken from spec-surge-Client.rcS
What exactly does this specific command line do?
And other command line options in the other benchmark applications listed in the Benchmark.py file. Is there a 'man' type file for these command line applications?
Thanks
Lanier
