Hi Ali thanks for your answer, I do not know what you mean. Are you saying that I should create the Disk Image in another machine in which I have root privileges? and after how do I submit that disk image to the machine in which I have m5 installed?, I should run the simulation in that machine because it is much faster than mine. Thank you.

No, you don't need to have root privileges on the machine that you're
running M5 on, but you do need them on some system because the mount
requires root privileges. You could run linux inside a VM or with a
emulator such as Bochs for this purpose.
