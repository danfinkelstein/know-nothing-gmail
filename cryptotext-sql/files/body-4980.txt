Thank you for this!
I was just working on something similar when I found your post.
Now I just have to adapt it to the Lgred datasets. I do have a few
questions though, that I hope you might be able to answer.
1. Why do you have a specific constructor calling the LiveProcess
base class? I thought this would be done automatically.
2. There is a lot of duplicate code, is there any reason that you haven't
made a class like Gzip that sets f.ex "executable" and let GzipSource
inherit that from Gzip?
Is there any way to set the working directory for the simulated binary?
Copying the files work, but it is a bit dirty...
Thanks in advance!
