The short answer is yes, M5 does do cache to cache transfers for
a CMP. 
 
By varying the latency, what do you mean? Varying the latency
during simulation, or between simulations? 
 
 
 
I am new to m5. Could you please tell me what m5 does in
case of LOAD for shared cache line. Basically I need a CMP system with private
L2 caches, and in case
of LOAD, the request should be satisfied by peer L2 caches (of course if it is
available) instead of going to memory. I want to vary the latency for cache to
cache transfer.
Does the current coherence in m5 work this way?? Or, how hard will it be to
change?
thanks
