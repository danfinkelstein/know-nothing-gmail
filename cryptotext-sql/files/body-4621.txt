Sometimes we've seen a problem where scons doesn't properly create symlinks from build/ALPHA_FS/python/*.i -> src/python/swig/*.i Could you try to create these and let us know if that fixes your problem.

Hi,
After updating the SWIG version on the server I keep getting this error when I
try to compile:
scons: *** [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'build/ALPHA_FS/python/swig/debug.i'
scons: building terminated because of errors.
The correct versions of SCONS and SWIG are installed. What is causing this
error?
