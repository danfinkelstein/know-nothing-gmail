BTW, this is using ts_osfpal, not tsb_osfpal, which is why I didn't expect BIG_TSUNAMI to be needed.- Show quoted text -On Tue, May 5, 2009 at 8:53 AM, Steve Reinhardt <stever@gmail.com> wrote:
Thanks, that helps a lot... I must have missed that email.  It works now, but only if I set CONFIG_BIG_TSUNAMI=y.  (The .config.m5 in the patch queue doesn't set this either way, so you have to pick one when you build.)  If I don't set it, the console output ends like this:

GCC 4.1 generates invalid code. You need to use 4.3. I have a post on the m5 mailing list a few months ago where I discussed the particular issue in detail, but it has to do with dependence analysis across call pal's being completely broken with gcc 4.0-4.2.
