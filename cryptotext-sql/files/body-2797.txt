Hello,
     I am trying to get the 
dynamic values of the system configuration and use it in a custom .cc file in 
M5. For example, I would like to get the numcpus, or L2 size, etc. which is 
either in the .py files or specified in the config files. How do I get these 
values and use it in my files?
 
Thanks,
Sujay
