Hi all,
I have been working to get Jiayuan Meng's directory coherence model
working for full system m5-dev. I had a question about an IO-Cache. If
you have an I/O cache connected between the memory bridge and iobus, do
have have to keep the IO-cache coherent as a level 3 cache (I have
connections cpu->l1-cache->l2-bus,
l2->cache->membus->membridge->IO-cache->iobus) ? I guess I am wondering
if the IO-cache has to be apart of coherent memory.
Best,
-Rick
