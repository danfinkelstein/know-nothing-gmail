Sorry about that, not sure how that happened.  the spec-surg-client.rcS file should have "cd /benchmarks/surge" instead of "cd benchmarks/specsurge" and i believe that should work.lisa- Show quoted text -

HiI am trying to run specweb99 benchmarks with apache running on theserver side.  I tried using "-b SurgeSpecweb", but it seems the latestlinux disk image from the website doesn't have necessary files for
running apache and also some paths are not set correctly in thespec-surge-server.rcS and spec-surge-client.rcS files. Are these scriptssupposed to run with the latest disk image? Am I missing sth here?
