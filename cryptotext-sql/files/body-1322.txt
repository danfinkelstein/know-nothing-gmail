Hi,
I am trying to add some functionally to change the lookup process of the L2 cache.
Almost all the changes are in lru.cc. I get the following error when I run any benchmark on my implementation.
**** REAL SIMULATION ****
info: Entering event queue @ 0. Starting simulation...
Ocean simulation with W-cycle multigrid solver
Processors : 4
Grid size : 18 x 18
Grid resolution (meters) : 20000.00
Time between relaxations (seconds) : 28800
Error tolerance : 1e-07
panic: Tried to access unmapped address 0.
@ cycle 33427000
[invoke:build/SPARC_SE/arch/sparc/faults.cc, line 647]
Memory Usage: 2245404 KBytes
For more information see: http://www.m5sim.org/panic/5932f339
Program aborted at cycle 33427000
Aborted
I already tried to increase the physical memory but it doesn't seem to be the problem.
Can someone give some pointers.
Thanks,
Siddharth
