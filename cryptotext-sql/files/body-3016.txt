  Hi, I have two questions.(1) I think there is no member variable in the enum CacheBlkStatusBits type that signify the owned state of the MOESI cache coherence.(2) What is the relationship between the Addr of the class Packet and that of the class Request where the Addr has two different forms, that is: Vaddr and Paddr?Thank you!
