You're program is doing lots of set up work for you before it gets to main, and those are all still going to happen even if main doesn't do anything.

Hi,
I am trying to figure out the following issue:
When I run a "null" program (empty main function without anything), there
are still more than 160 dcache misses, and more than 200 icache misses. Is
that normal? Or where do they come from?
I am using SE mode with one core and the version is 1.1
Thanks a lot,
Qingyuan
