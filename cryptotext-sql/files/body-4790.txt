Hi Kevin,
The patch didn't apply cleanly in my source. It changed InitStage(), not DefaultFetch() (which both set cacheBlkSize). That seemed to fix it though.
Manually fixing DefaultFetch() according to your diff resulted in a segmentation fault:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[Switching to Thread -1211881808 (LWP 6914)]
DefaultFetch (this=0x888a8e0, params=0x888a098) at build/ALPHA_SE/mem/port.hh:215
215         int peerBlockSize() { return peer->deviceBlockSize(); }

Hi Jonas, regarding problem 2 on your list, I forgot to update the O3 CPU's
code to grab the cache line size from the cache itself.  It was being
hardcoded to 64 bytes.  This diff below shows how to fix it.  Simple testing
with 32 byte cache lines works, but let me know if you run into any other
problems.
