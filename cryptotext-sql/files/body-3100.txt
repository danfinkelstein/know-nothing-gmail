Did you look at these?

If you go to http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Mailing_Lists and
search past traffic on the mailing lists (m5-users particularly) you
will find something. If I recall rightly you really need to go to full
system mode to get thread support (since in that case you have the
full OS underneath you, scheduling is handled in the kernel).
I did a quick check and found some activity on Gmane but The Mail
Archive while finding the headers appears to have lost the content of
older messages.
