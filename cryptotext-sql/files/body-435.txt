Also, someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the "t" is for
"ticks" (ie periods of the global clock) rather than terahertz. If you
want to change a clock frequency, I think you need to use units like GHz
or ghz or similar. You can probably find examples of that in the configs
directory. You should also not change the settings in BaseCPU.py because
you'd be changing the default value for all CPUs in the simulation. That
would work if all CPUs were supposed to be the same, but really the
better way would be to either subclass the base CPU in your python
configuration script, or to instantiate a CPU and update its settings
individually. The following link should explain how that all works.
