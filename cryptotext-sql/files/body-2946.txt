Hi Brad,
I created the other config files, but I don't have one for 2.6.22. If you want one you should just start with the 2.6.18 config file and if you attempt to make the kernel you'll get prompted for any new parameters that weren't in 2.6.18.

Hi,
Could you please point me to the patch file for the .config.m5 file needed for Linux 2.6.22? Â I notice that the Linux Patches tarball contains defaultconfig files for 2.6.13, 2.6.16, and 2.6.18, but not 2.6.22.
Thanks for your help!
Brad
