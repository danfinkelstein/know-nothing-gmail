Hello,
      I was wondering 
what happens to files generated by a benchmark when running in FS mode. I think 
the virtual disk is opened only in read mode so are the files simply lost? Or 
can they be written back to the native disk?
 
If they are lost, how do we compare the outputs 
from spec to the reference outputs?
