Can you give the specific context where you're using it? Â It calls name() to grab the name of the enclosing SimObject if you use it in a SimObject method, but there's also a global name() function that it should find if it's not in a SimObject method.
You can run into problems if you use it in a template of a SimObject method though.

Hi,
I am using M5_1.1.
I am trying to insert DPRINTF statement in /mem/cache/coherence/coherence_protocol.cc, which works in many other files.
However, I always get the same error:
m5/mem/cache/coherence/coherence_protocol.cc:208: error: cannot call member function `virtual const std::string SimObject::name() const' without object
I looked into other files and included the
#include "base/trace.hh" // for DPRINTF
But the error is still there.
Can anybody tell me how to fix that?
Thanks,
Chenjie
