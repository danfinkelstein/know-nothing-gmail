Hi. X86 is still a work in progress so it's not too hard to believe you've
found a bug. If you email me your binary and modified se.py directly I can
take a look at it.
Also, you might have been able to use se.py without modification. You can
pass arguments to it from the command line to change what
command/executable it simulates, although there's nothing wrong with
modifying it to suit your needs.
