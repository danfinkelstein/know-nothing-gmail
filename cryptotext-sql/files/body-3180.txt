Geoff Blake noticed that the alpha/linux cross compiler we posted on the website was old enough to only support LinuxThreads. He has compiled a new version that supports NPTL and I put it on the download page. If you have no idea what I'm talking about then it probably doesn't effect you, however if anyone is running multi-threaded workloads in full-system and using our cross-compiler they should be aware.
Thanks,
Ali
