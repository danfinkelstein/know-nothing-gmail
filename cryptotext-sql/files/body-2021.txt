sim_seconds is the amount of time simulated in seconds
sim_ticks is the amount of time simulated in "ticks" where some number
of ticks are in a second (by default 1,000,000,000,000)
host_seconds is the amount of time the simulation took in real time
(how long you were staring at your watch for)
It would appear that your program is not CPU bound, but is probably
memory bound. Increasing the CPU frequency won't help in that case you
would need to increase the bandwidth or decrease the latency to memory
to see a performance improvement.
