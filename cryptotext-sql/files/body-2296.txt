No it's probably from all the libc _start code that is executed. Even
if main() is a single line there is much more code that is included in
the binary to setup the environment properly, get the arguments in
order, see if the terminal is character or line buffered, etc. You
should be able to convince the linker to not include all of this -fno-
builtin, but you'll need to define a _start symbol.
