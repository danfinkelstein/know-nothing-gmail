Hi
 
I understand that some features are disabled in the beta
version pending the release of version 2.0.
I have a few questions.
I downloaded the beta2 of version 2.0.
The readme file says that multiprocessor coherence is
disabled. Is that so?
Also what other features are disabled in the beta version?
When do you anticipate releasing version 2?
 
Thanks
Roger Kahn
