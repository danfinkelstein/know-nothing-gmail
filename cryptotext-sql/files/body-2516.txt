Hi Meng-Ju,
Thanks for creating that page. It's great and will probably help a lot
of people. Looking at the development repository we've implemented
ftruncate(), getrlimit(), and getcwd(), but we don't yet have code for
mremap(). I thought about including your code, however I don't
understand what it's doing.
It seems like the simplest implementation is to do what you've done,
just allocate a new chunk of memory and say the start address has
moved. This leaks memory because the previous memory will never be
reclaimed, but it might be ok. I don't quite see the code you have on
the wiki doing this though. You allocated a new region that is new-old
large and place it at the end of the mmap and then set the start
address to the original address. This will work if mremap() is
remapping the previous mmap(), but otherwise it won't work. Minimally,
there probably needs to be a check that verifies that is what's
happening (I think start + old_size == p->mmap_end will do it) and if
not re-allocate the entire region. There probably should also be a
panic() in there if mremap is called more than a handful of times, as
it would start to create a memory footprint that didn't match reality.
If you have a few minutes could you address that problem and clean the
code up a little bit. I would like to commit it to the repository so
that people won't have to patch m5 to get the spec cpu 2006 benchmarks
to work.
Thanks,
Ali
