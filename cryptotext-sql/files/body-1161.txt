Hi all:
    I would like to use the fetch event to put a fetch function call
on to the event queue and pop that call off the event on the next
tick. I tried
schedule(fetchEvent, nextCycle(curTick + tick(delay))), but the event
queue doesn't seem to pop the fetchEvent off at time curTick +
tick(delay).
    Could someone explain to me how the event queue of M5 works? And
how I should use events with M5? I did not find any documentation
about it on the ASPLOS slides.
    Thanks for any comments in advance.
