Hi all,
 
I read the cache implementation 
file "Cache_impl.hh" and found that there might be some inaccuracy in 
function handleResponse() when data cach misses happen. Also, I have some other 
questions.
 
When the function begin to satisfy the CPU side 
request, it first calculates "initial_offset", which should be 
the block offset for the first target(request) in MSHR. I found 
that if the offset of first target in MSHR is > 0 then there will 
be some inaccuracy. This is because the next "transfer_offset" will be set 
as 0, and the "completion_time" will be "HitLatency 
+  firstWordTime". However, if the cache offset of the first 
target in MSHR is >0, this critical word should arrive after the first 
word, and the "completion_time" should after "firstWordTime". So the 
caculation "completion_time" is not right. Since the "completion_time" is 
the time sending the request back to CPU, there will be some 
inaccuracy.
If the the cache offset of the first target in 
MSHR is equal to 0, then it is accurate. 
 
Here is some tarce results (bus width: 8 Bytes, bus 
and CPU freqency : 1GHz):
 
102020: system.membus: recvTiming: src 0 dst 2 
ReadResp 0x86940
102020: system.cpu.dcache: cache handleResponse 
initial_offset: 24102020: system.cpu.dcache: cache handleResponse 
transfer_offset: 0102020: system.cpu.dcache: cache handleResponse 
pkt->finishTime:112000, pkt->firstWordTime:105000, 
completion_time:106000
106000: system.cpu.iew.lsq-dport: recvTiming 
pkt->size:8, pkt->addr: 0x86958
 
This is a data cache miss in address 0x86958. The 
offset is 24. In this case, the completion_time is the time when the first word 
arrives at cache. Apparently at tick 106000 the critical words has not 
arrived at cache and we should send it at at least tick 108000.
 
 
I also have some questions:
1. Why there is a difference 
in caculating "completion_time" between FirstWord and the rest words 
in a block("(transfer_offset ? pkt->finishTime : pkt->firstWordTime);"). 
That is, why it sends the first word to CPU immediatedly after it arrives at 
cache, and send the other words to CPU after the whole block arrives at 
cache? 
 
2. In most CPUs, when a cache miss 
happens, does the cache send the critical word to CPU first, and 
then store the data to cache block? Or store the data in cache block first and 
then send the critical word? Will this make much diffence in the performance of 
CPU?
