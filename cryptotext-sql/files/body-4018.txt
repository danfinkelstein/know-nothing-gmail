Yes, the cache coherence protocol is largely rewritten, and is no
longer configurable (it's hardwired as MOESI).  The primary goal was
to allow multi-level coherence in some workable form, and once you get
past simple single-bus snooping you can't really parameterize things
very easily (not that it worked all that well in the old version,
actually).

Specifically, how does coherence protocol works in the new version, if different protocols need to be selected like in the previous version, or not to specify one at all.
