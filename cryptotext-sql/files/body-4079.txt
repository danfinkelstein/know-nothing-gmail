I need a simulator that can do simulation for network-on-chip with different topology, routing algorithm, router architecture, or different bus topology.I also need to implement some blocks or units to the network-on-chip so that I can verify that my optimization design on the network-on-chip can improve performnce , power consumption and reliability, scalability. I also expect the simulator can generate the detailed information about  cycle-accurate, packet-level bus behavior.   I found  "m5" simulator here.
 I do not know weather it can give me what I need.  Would you please help me with it ? Or could you please recommmand other simulator for Network-on-chip?thanks a lot !!!TonyOct.  25  2007   - Show quoted text - __________________________________________________Do You Yahoo!?Tired of spam?
