The code in vtophys is for the simulator to be able to translate a virtual address to a physical one for whatever purpose. It manually walks the page table and figures out what the address should be returning it  whatever asked(for example overwriting a value in memory, or reading an in-kernel structure during execution to figure out what thread is currently scheduled).  It is not called during the normal translation process for a tlb miss. Alpha has a software filled TLB (not a HW filled one) so the palcode entry point for a tlb miss (e.g. dtb_miss_single) executes instructions to walk the page table and fill the tlb.

Hi Ali,
   Thank you for your patience.
   I have read the section II-B of alpha architecture handbook. I know alpha
uses multilevel Page Table structure.
   As you said, on a TLB miss the PAL code searches the page table for the
 missing entry. I found the multilevel page table lookup function is
implemented in vtophys.cc(AlphaISA::kernel_pte_lookup()). But on a TLB
miss, this function is not called. So I am confused about how the PAL
code gets the appropriate entry?
    Thanks.

Briefly, on a TLB miss the PAL code searches the page table for the
missing entry, when it finds the appropriate entry it writes to an
Internal Processor Register (IPR) that causes the entry to be
inserted into the TLB. Section II-B Chapter 3 of the Alpha
Architecture Handbook provides the particular details of the process.

Hi,
   Now I am trying to add some new virtual to physical address
translation
algorithm in full system.I know this functionality is done in tlb.cc,
but I don't know how the TLB is build up, which means how TLB entries
are added into the table?
   I find AlphaRegFile::MiscRegFile::setIpr() is called to insert a
new
entry. Can anyone explain this process for me?
   Thank you very much.

translate() in tlb.cc implements an alpha like TLB. So it does
virtual to physical translation for the guest.
vtophys() converts a virtual address for the guest into a virtual
address for the host.

Hi all,
    I find two virtual to physical address translation functions in
M5:
    One is translate() defined in AlphaITB/AlphaDTB class in tlb.cc,
    the other one is vtophys() defined in vtophys.cc.
    Does anyone know which one is for simulated virtual address to
simulated physical address translation? And which on is for
simulated
virutal address to host physical address translation?
    Thanks!
Tracy
