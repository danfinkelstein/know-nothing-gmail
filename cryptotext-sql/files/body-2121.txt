Hello again, is this problem finally solved?,
I think that for my goal I can do it in another way the only thing
that I want to do, is just load the linux in SE mode take a checkpoint
and after switch to FS. I will repeat the commands that I am using.
To take the inital checkpoint
./build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt -d  ./tmp/output  configs/example/fs.py -b
MyBench --checkpoint-dir=./checkpoint/
To restore from the checkpoint and do the switching:
./build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt -d  ./tmp/output  configs/example/fs.py -b
MyBench  --caches --l2cache -s -w 200000000000 -r 1
--checkpoint-dir=./checkpoint/
If there is no way to do this without have this problem, is there any
way to know when the simulator has load linux and is executing my
script?. I am getting some information from the simulation and I am
interested in know when that simulation is from my program and when
from the Linux.
Thank you.
