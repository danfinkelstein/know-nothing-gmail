We're not trying to keep secrets.  Basically, the developers of GEMS
and the developers of M5 are experimenting with replacing the M5 cache
hierarchy with the ruby cache hierarchy with the goal of having the
best of both simulators.  If we succeed, we will have a better
simulator and we can have a larger team sharing the burden of
simulator design.  It is still very preliminary work, and no where
near ready for consumption.  I'm sure that as we become more
successful, we'll announce more about it.
