It's certainly not impossible, but there's no support for it out of
the box.  You'd have to extend the memory system yourself to model
NUMA and whatever coherence protocol you want to use.  That's doable
but not a small task.
Jiayuan Meng at UVA has done this already:

Unfortunately due to time pressures on our side we haven't gone
through the process of integrating his code into the release.  He may
be willing to share his patches with you directly.
