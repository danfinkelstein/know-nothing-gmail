Everything should be in Ticks (which is ps). If some calculation is not then it's a bug. The warning that is printed when the DRAM object is used says it best: While it doesn't effect functional correctness, the model has not been tested or validated in any way since being integrated in M5 v2.0. There maybe bugs.
If you specify something like cas_lat = '2ns' M5 does a calculation based on what units Ticks are (normally ps) and would put the appropriate value in cal_lat (2000 if ticks are ps).

Hello all,
       I am a little confused about the latency and Tick units used for calculations in the dram.cc, using v2beta4. If I understand correctly, all dram latency parameters (like cas_lat) are in nanoseconds, while variables like time_since_last_access, currTick are of type Tick (which I assume runs at 1THz simticks speed).
So If we are using these together, shouldnt there be some scaling factor of 1000 in the expression. I am referring to the following calculations done in dram.cc:
...
            overlap=(int)(busy_until[current_bank] - curTick);
...
...
            corrected_overlap = overlap*((int)(1/cpu_ratio)); /* floor */
....
....
....
                            else/*in between case*/
                              {
                                lat = cas_lat-corrected_overlap;
overlap and corrected_overlap are converted to (int) but doesnt the value still represent time in picoseconds? whereas lat is in nanos.
Or this:
----------
 total_arb_latency += (busy_until[current_bank]
                                - curTick - lat
                                - timing_correction);
Again, except lat, it seems like other variables are all in picoseconds.
I would really appreciate your help on this.
Thanks,
Sujay
