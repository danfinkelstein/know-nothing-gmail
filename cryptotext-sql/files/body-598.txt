Hi Lukasz,
What do you mean by m5threads? Are you trying to parallelize m5 from scratch?
What is m5thread library?
I'm working on parallelizing m5 as well. I'm also using OpenMP. I haven't
finished my work yet (I'm a student and have exams till the end of the month).
I'm planning on finishing programming shortly after my exams. There is a
large, recent thread on the m5-dev list titled "parallelizing m5" in which we
discussed several issues concerning parallelization.
http://www.mail-archive.com/m5-dev@m5sim.org/msg05013.html
I have had success with running multiple separate "Systems" (m5 System
SimObjects) in parallel but simulating "interacting" components in parallel
requires some substantial changes and thus more work.
I'm planning on contributing my changes but since I have to finish my master's
thesis first, getting my code in a good enough form might have to wait till
spring.
Good luck

Hello,
I am having problems with getting m5threads to work with OpenMP codes. All
of my multithreaded codes build and compile with m5thread library correctly,
but only OpenMP codes do not seem to run in multithreaded mode. Also, all
tests included in the m5thread package pass except for the OpenMP one. I
would appreciate any help.
Lukasz
