In order to fully understand that interface you might want to check the CPU Model Documentation:
http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/CPU_Models
specifically for the O3CPU and specifically the fetch stage.

If this is the case, than in the most basic case all you need to do is increase the fetchPC by two instructions instead of by one when the PC is updated. 
 
So Like Nate said, you are going to do some hacking around to get things working, but just to start you off, you might want to check the 
lookAndUpdateNextPC() function in the fetch stage (src/cpu/o3/fetch_impl.hh).
 
In the simple, non-branching case, you could just update the next PC based on the cpu ID of the processor (the following is JUST PSEUDOCODE):
pc = nextPC + (4 * cpu_id)
 
But how you would handle branch prediction across processors in the same instruction stream... well ... that's the interesting, complicated, and unknown part (for me at least)!
 
Anyway, good luck with everything and I hope that helps ...- Show quoted text -

(or write your own model).  The code that is there now was not at allwritten to do what you want, so there's no way around you modifying what'sthere.  Nate_______________________________________________
