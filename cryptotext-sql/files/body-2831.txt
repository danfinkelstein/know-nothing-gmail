hi,i am trying to run 8 core with each having 4 threads, using O3CPU.  the number of instruction to be run by each thread is 10M. the threads are loaded with speccpu2000 benchmarks. but while rub the simulation, i am getting error like
fatal: out of lex buffer streams, increase MAX_STREAMS @ cycle 0[yy_setstream:/z/stever/bk/m5/eio/exolex.l, line 201]the simulation ran successfully for 4 core 2 thread and 8 core 1 thread system. What may be the reason for this? is there any limitation on the number of threads m5 can handle? 
would appreaciate if someone help me to solve this problemthank uprannav
