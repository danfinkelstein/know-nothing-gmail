There's no great way currently.  I think the best option is to add
things to the linux command line using the system.boot_osflags
parameter.  Then you can read them by looking at /proc/cmdline.  With
a little bit of intelligent scripting, you can accomplish a fair
amount using this method.
That said, I'm mostly done with a rather elaborate replacement for the
rcS files that allow you to have multiple rcS files and pass
parameters into M5.  I need it for my own work, so I'd hope to have it
in the tree relatively soon.
