Hi all,
 
I just used the patch from Clint to integrate DRAMsim to M5 simulator. 
When applying the patch there is an error message showing that "bus.cc" was 
unsuccessfully applied tha patch. So I manualy add the following codes 
from patch file to "bus.cc":
 
+    Tick headerFinishTime, 
packetFinishTime;+    if (pkt->isExpressSnoop()) 
{+       headerFinishTime = 
0;+       packetFinishTime = 
0;+       pkt->firstWordTime = 
pkt->finishTime = curTick;+    } else 
{+       headerFinishTime = 
calcPacketTiming(pkt);+       packetFinishTime 
= pkt->finishTime;+    }
 
However, when I compile the simulator, there is an 
error message showing that the function "calcPacketTiming" was not 
defined. Then I looked in to the patch file and found that the "bus.cc" file was 
added the above codes with no new ".hh" file 
included.  So is there anything missed in the 
patch?
I think the function "prparePacket" already 
caculate the finishTime. Why this calcPacketTiming is needed here? So may be we 
can just not apply "bus.cc" part of the 
patch file. After I comment those 
patched codes in "bus.cc", the compilation is success.
