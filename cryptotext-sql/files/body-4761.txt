I'm sorry , E-mail that I sent is mistake.
I confused "default .py file" and "my .py file"
This problem is caused by " Prefetch in Multiprocessors".
According to
"Adaptive Sequential Prefetching in Multiprocessor Systems Using M5".
Robert Mullenix, Michael Zajac (University of Michigan)
, M5 prefeching only supports uniprocessor configuration.
I'm trying to runnig Splash2 in MultiProcessors with hard ware prefetching.
Could you tell me how to fix this problem ?
thanks,
