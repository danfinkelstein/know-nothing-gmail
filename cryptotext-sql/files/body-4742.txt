Hi Steve,
Thanks for the reply. I agree with you, but it's really a weird case.

Hi Yu,
The TCP behavior you see is determined solely by the Linux kernel.  M5
is running the actual Linux kernel code.  I can't say offhand why you're
seeing the behavior you describe, but I'm 99% positive it's a Linux
issue and not an M5 issue.

Hi,
I'm running some simulation on TCP/IP workload. And something unexpected
happened to me. As we know, TCP will play fast retransmit when the
sender receive 3 or more duplicate ACKs asap. However, on my
observation, sometimes, when the sender see the duplicate ACKs, it will
not trigger a fast retransmit, instead, a timeout is set up, which means
it will take much longer time to complete the retransmission. I'm quite
confused on this. I tracked the packets, and I'm sure that the duplicate
ACKs successfully arrived at the sender side. As much as I know, such
behavior of TCP is not reasonable. How is TCP implemented on M5?
Thanks,
Yu
