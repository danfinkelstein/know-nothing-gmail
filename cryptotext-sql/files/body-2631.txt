Hi Rick,
There isn't a mechanism built-in, however you could create one
reasonably easily by  adding a PC based even (like the
DebugPrintkEvent) and have it break on the entSys symbol in the
kernel. You would have to do some more work to change the syscall
number into a name, but all that information exists in M5.
