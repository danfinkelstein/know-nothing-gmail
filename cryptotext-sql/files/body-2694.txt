Hi James,
  Thanks for the advice.  This still works with the current version of M5 as well.

has changed in m5 v2 but I have a Python script called m5.launch runningin the vanilla universe that sets up some environment variables(corresponding to which configuration and benchmark to run) which thendoes something like:
process = subprocess.Popen(...)process.wait()So the condor submission file looks like this:# Condor submission file# Generic thingsuniverse        = vanillaexecutable      = /homes/jrs53/src/m5/m5/bin/m5.launch
#requirements   = memory >= 4000output          = $ENV(M5_RESULTS)_condor/out.gzip_sourceerror           = $ENV(M5_RESULTS)_condor/err.gzip_sourcelog             = $ENV(M5_RESULTS)_condor/log.gzip_source
arguments       = --benchmark=gzip_source--results=$ENV(M5_RESULTS)_gzip_source--fast_cycles=$ENV(M5_FAST_CYCLES)--detail_cycles=$ENV(M5_DETAIL_CYCLES) --config=$ENV(M5_CONFIG) --sim=$ENV(M5_SIM)queue           1
(may wrap)This may be needlessly complex and was originally necessary to getaround some file permissions issues on our system. If you can log indirectly to the condor machines try running m5 from there and see what
happens.Hope this helps,James--James.Srinivasan@cl.cam.ac.ukhttp://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrs53/
