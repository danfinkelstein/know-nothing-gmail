Hello,
I am testing Blackscholes 2.1 on M5. Alpha FS Mode. It seems that the
IPC is pretty low around .73, I noticed that the fetching rate is
pretty low , avg fetch of .98 per cycle, out of a 4 wide machine.
Going through traces, everything seems normal except: I get messages
like this doing certain spots, which I believe is the culprit:
8039402330674: system.detail_cpu1.fetch: Running stage.
8039402330674: system.detail_cpu1.fetch: There are no more threads
available to fetch from.
This happens for several cycles, then fetching appears normal.
Right now I have two cores running two threads. Is there anyways I can
find out more about whats going on?
Thanks,
EF
