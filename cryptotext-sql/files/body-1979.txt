Thank you Isuru, I have tried to run splash2 under ALPHA-SE mode, the precompiled splash program ran well. But I have encountered a problem when compiling the splashalpha-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc: unrecognized option `-non_shared'
../../../../../parmacs.upc.3/pthreads/libparmacs_pthreads.a: could not read symbols: Archive has no index; run ranlib to add onecollect2: ld returned 1 exit statusmake: *** [OCEAN] Error 1In the original makefile, the compiler is cc, I replaced it with alpha-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc. 
I deleted the -non_shared and ran ranlib but the problem remained. Is there any problem with the parmacs.Â  I downloaded the splash and the crosstool from the wiki. Thanks !
Dear Veydan
If you need to do modifications to the splash code, then use a cross compiler
from (http://www.kegel.com/crosstool/) to compile the modified splash program.
Then use them in SE mode with -c option. I like this feature of SE mode because
you dont need to create an image with your programs. Three simple steps.
Write your c program.
Compile using the cross compiler.
Give the location of binaries as an command line argument to the SE mode.
regards,
Isuru
