dprintk() only works in the kernel. When we read in the kernel file we search for the PC of the symbol dprintk() and trap on that PC. If you're debugging an application you'll have to come up with something else, although remote gdb will still work.

hi: Ali Saidi
Thank for your reply.
But I am puzzling about how to link the lib that implemented the function dprintk(...) to my application?
I am using -static opition when compiling my application with other libs.
Best Regards For You!

Hi,
So there are a couple of methods that you can use to debug, but they probably will only work with a simple system where a processor is
directly attached to memory if you're using m5 2.0b. In the future will be fixing it to work no matter what but we haven't gotten around to
it yet.?
If you look at one of the kernel we have on the website (e.g. m5base-2.6.13) there is an include file include/linux/m5dprintk.h. If you
include this header file you can use dprink() just like you would normally use printf() and if you enable the DebugPrintf trace flag in the
simulator the simulator will trap all calls to dprintk() and print whatever you want to the simulator screen. It will do all the string
formatting for you so it won't perturb the system much.?
Another thing you can do is remotely attach a copy of gdb to the simulator. For this to work you need an alpha targeted version of gdb.

I am running my application in fs mode, but?it gave out a segment fault?message(Note: This is not a?fault?of the simulator.).
I have run it in my real system(x86) successfully.?I want to debug it on the simulated system, but?I just found some dubugging methods that
debug the simulator itself or debug the linux kernel simulted.
?
Is there any method that can debug the application?on the simulated system?
Thanks a lot!
