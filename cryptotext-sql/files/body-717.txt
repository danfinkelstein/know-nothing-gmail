Hi,
I am considering using M5 for my research and need to know if M5
supports SSE istructions?
From what I looked up, seems like it doesn't. I know that x86 is not
yet supported,
but  I was wondering if there's any other way I can study the
overhead/performance of SSE in M5?
thanks.

PS:
I want to study the overhead of packing/unpacking of data, performance
of SSE etc for a certain class of application;
I also want to see which instruction is in which stage of the pipeline
at a certain time and which instruction is being issued/retiring at a
certain time.
Are these possible at all?
