You can modify the exit() syscall to not exits until the number of CPUs in the system all have called exit(). That would solve the problem, however it's not completely clear that's what you want to do. If you're running a multiprogrammed workload you probably want to capture time when all the programs are running. The only reason I could see doing otherwise was if you were running all the benchmarks from beginning to end.

Thanks for all your help.
Can you give me more details about how to control the system so that all threads were done before system halt?
Regards,
Jerry
