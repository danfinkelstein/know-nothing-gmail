The lat_mem_rd benchmark from lmbench can be used to do this. You can
configure the stride and memory size so you can measure the
performance of various layers of the memory hierarchy.
If you are really conserned about the DRAM model I think the best plan
there would be to get one of the other DRAM models people have written
but haven't made into the M5 tree and test those (Steve? Nate? do you
know where they are). The current model is quite a mess.
