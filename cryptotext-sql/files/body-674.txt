Hi
I am trying to use sched_setaffinity function in one of my benchmarks. The first time i tried it i got "sched_setaffinity: Function not implemented". Then I found this http://www.mail-archive.com/m5sim-users@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01925.html which says I should upgrade my kernel. So, then I upgraded my kernel to 2.6.27, but still i get the same message when I run sched_setaffinity. Is there anything else I should do? Should I config the kernel differently?
ThanksAmir
