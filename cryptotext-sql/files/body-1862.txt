Hi Steve It would be a great help for me if you can provide me those patch about the caches and also how to apply that patches so that I can continue my research work without this interruptionThanksAshutosh Jain

There are a number of bugs in the prefetcher currently... we received some patches from the list a while ago, and I have applied those patches and fixed several others in my internal tree, but haven't had the chance to push those to the public repository yet.  I'll try and put that higher on my to-do list.

HiI am trying to run ghb prediction applied over L3 cache. While running the simulation, I have following configuration on L3 cache which is depicted on config.ini which I got after simulation.Part of config.ini  containing info for L3 cache where I have used prefetch_policy to be ghb :::

cpu_side=system.tol3aBus.port[0]mem_side=system.membus.port[1]I am getting the statistics for l3 cache overall miss rate. But the point is its showing the same value unchanges on both the cases - when I have applied ghb prefetch technique and and when I haven't applied any prediction technique. I am in whimsical situation why the two simulations(one with prediction technique and other without the prediction technique) gives the same value for l3 cache miss rate......
Thanks is advance-- Ashutosh Jain
