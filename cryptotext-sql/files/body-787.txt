Hi Amir,
You should be able to use any version you want. The only caveat is that the
CPU model doesn't support every Alpha instruction. Specifically the MVI
instructions aren't implemented and CTPOP. You either need to configure the
compiler to not generate these/not use them or implement them. If you
wanted to implement them it would probably take a day of work as there are
only 16 instructions missing.
