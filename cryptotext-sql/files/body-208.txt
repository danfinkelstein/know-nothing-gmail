Hi,I am new to M5 and I was trying to understand the L1 stats collection. So I wrote the following program:#define size 3000int main(){  int a[size] ;  int i;  for(i=0; i<size; i++)
  {     a[i] = i;  }  for(i=0; i<size; i++)  {     a[i] = a[i] + size;  } return 0;}The L1 cache that i had in the config file is:class L1(BaseCache):    latency = options.l1latency
    block_size = 64    mshrs = 1    tgts_per_mshr = 1    assoc = 1and the size of the cache is merely 512 B.In this example, i am moving over the array. Their should be a lot of evictions and replacements as the cache has assoc 1. But i get only around 1% miss in the dcache.
system.cpu.dcache.ReadReq_accesses              27769                       # number of ReadReq accesses(hits+misses)system.cpu.dcache.ReadReq_hits                  27423                       # number of ReadReq hits
system.cpu.dcache.ReadReq_miss_rate          0.012460                       # miss rate for ReadReq accessesI have a couple of questions. 1) What misses are considered as dcache misses? I added an L2 cache and by decreasing the size of the L2 cache, L2 cache hits decreased dramatically but dcache hits had no effect.
2) What is the best way to learn about such stuff? I turned on --trace-flags=all and there were misses in dcache and L2 but i could not make out which stat was getting updated because of that.Any help in this regards is greatly appreciated.
