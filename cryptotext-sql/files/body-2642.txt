Hi Nate,Thank you very much for informing me about this.I was using suif (running on Tru64/OSF machines) to generate SUIF2 IR. I implemented some profiling passes in machsuif, which take in SUIF2 IR programs.
The problem is, suif uses target specific header files to generate SUIF2 IR, and therefore, even if I compile the machsuif output (assembly files) with the gcc (crosstool) targeting m5, I get incorrect results. machsuif does not need target specific files.
I tried getting suif use the include files of the gcc (crosstool) for m5, but I have not been succesful. The only other option that I can think of is reimplementing all my profiling passes in gcc :(, and switch to gcc.
If someone has found a way to get suif generated code targeting Alpha work with m5 [or have an easier solution to my problem], could you please help me?Thank you very much!Regards,Arun- Show quoted text -

I don't know that we can distribute the Tru64 image since it is
licensed code.  Furthermore, it has probably been nearly 4 years since
anyone has booted Tru64 and there are several known issues with trying
to do so again. Is there some reason that you want to run Tru64
instead of linux?
