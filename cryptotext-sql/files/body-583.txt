Hi Max,
Please see if the problem persists with the dev branch. There is a bug
with recvRetry() which is causing applu, gcc, and perlbmk to fail
(ref.  inorder test status page through the inorder documentation
page: http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/InOrder) even in the default
configuration (i.e. L1 hit latency 2 cycles, etc.). Korey has a patch
to fix it but it is currently untested.
Btw, a best case L1 hit latency of 2 cycles is not unrealistic for
high perf. processors (e.g. PowerPC MPC7450 family). Perhaps, somebody
else can comment on this for inorder processors.
regards,
Soumyaroop
