Hi All,
I have been looking into the memory model of the M5 simulator. In the
physical.cc file, I see that the doAtomicAccess function checks for
the memory command, which is either swap, read, write or invalidate
based on the checks over there. Can anyone tell what does the
invalidate command mean in terms of memory accesses? The problem is
that this function returns calculateLatency, which in detailed model
calls the DRAM calculateLatency function. That function just checks
for the memory access being a "read", and assumes it to be a "write"
if that is not the case. This implies, this function treats an
invalidate command as a write command, and returns a latency
corresponding to a write command. Is this correct behavior? If not,
then what should be the latency corresponding to an invalidate
command?
Thanks,
-Gaurav
