Hello there,
I am trying to build M5 on a SunOS running on a SPARC processor.
% uname -a
SunOS ogre 5.9 Generic_122300-07 sun4u sparc SUNW,Netra-T12
However, scons gives the following error when I try to build M5 in
ALPHA_SE configuration:
% scons build/ALPHA_SE/tests/debug/quick
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: warning: The Options class is deprecated; use the Variables
class instead.
File "/home/phd/sroy/m5sim/m5-stable/SConstruct", line 298, in <module>
Checking for leading underscore in global variables...no
Checking for C header file Python.h... no
Error: can't find Python.h header in /home/phd/sroy/python/include/python2.5
The header file is actually present in that location:
% ls /home/phd/sroy/python/include/python2.5/Python.h
/home/phd/sroy/python/include/python2.5/Python.h
The error is coming from these lines of the "SConstruct" script at
root directory:
   506  # include path, e.g. /usr/local/include/python2.4
   507  py_header_path = joinpath(sys.exec_prefix, 'include', py_version_name)
   508  env.Append(CPPPATH = py_header_path)
   509  # verify that it works
   510  if not conf.CheckHeader('Python.h', '<>'):
   511      print "Error: can't find Python.h header in", py_header_path
   512      Exit(1)
Is this error familiar, or is there a some problem at my end?
regards,
Soumyaroop.
