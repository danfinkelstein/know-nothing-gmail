Hello all,
    I am trying to run the specint 
benchmarks in SE mode in beta 5, using m5.fast. I am facing errors with some of 
them as follows:
 
I am running them on a machine with 2GB ram. I made 
the correction to the cpu2000.py script as suggested by Vilas in previous 
postings.
 
1. mcf - 
 
warn: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting 
simulation...warn: Increasing stack size by one page.fatal: Out of 
memory, please increase size of physical memory. @ cycle 
45551000[new_page:build/ALPHA_SE/sim/system.cc, line 235]
 
2. parser - 
AttributeError: OptionParser instance has no __call__ method. I think 
it needs input thru STDIN but does not seem to work
 
3. amongst the 
specint benchmarks, perlbmk and bzip2 do not have a smred input set. So what 
input_set options do we have to pass on?
 
Also, how do we check if the benchmarks ran 
correctly or no?
 
Has anyone gotten all these to run 
correctly?
thanks,
Sujay
