There hasn't been any support for this, and it would take a fair bit
of work (but it isn't impossible) to fix this.  The decision to
support integers only was deliberate since in a digital system, you're
generally counting events that only have integer values.  You can
multiply by a double, or something like that to generate a formula
though.
Can you explain a bit more about what you want to do with the double?
