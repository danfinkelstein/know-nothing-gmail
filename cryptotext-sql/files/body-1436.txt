I still find this surprising.  There's a whole handbook that's
basically on cross compiling, so at least perhaps it has come a long
way:
http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/embedded/handbook/
I think the biggest issue might be that you need a gentoo system as a
host, but with virtual machines, or even chroot, we should be able to
accomplish that.
