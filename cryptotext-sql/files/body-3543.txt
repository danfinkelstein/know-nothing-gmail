No, M5 doesn't support anything like that at this time. You can create a checkpoint of multi-programmed workloads, but you can't take two checkpoints of simple workloads and restore them to multiple cpus. It's not impossible to do but it would require a good bit of hacking on M5 to make work.

Hello Ali,
 Under the 'checkpoints' and/or 'simpoints' section are you going to discuss on how to restore multiple different checkpoints in a heterogeneous multiprocessor setup(different checkpoints restored for each processor or groups of processor) or possibly on an SMT machine(different checkpoints restored for each thread)?
thanks,
dean

Everyone,
Below is roughly the outline we've used for previous M5 tutorials.
We're in the process of updating our slides for the ASPLOS tutorial in
a few weeks and would like any input you have. Irrespective of if you
plan to attend the tutorial or not we would like input about what
should be covered in more detail and what we're spending too much time
on.
Thanks,
Ali
