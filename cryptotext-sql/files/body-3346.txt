Hi
 
When run ALPHA_SE/m5.debug, we got the following message.  Can anyone explain what might cause the "panic: stat check failed for" and how to fix the problem?  Thank you. panic: stat check failed for
 @ cycle 0[check:m5/base/statistics.cc, line 280]Program aborted at cycle 0Abort
Thanks in advance-- Ashutosh JainM.S. Computer Science,
