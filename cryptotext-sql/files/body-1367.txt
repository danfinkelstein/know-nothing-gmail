Thanks... I grabbed your binary and now I get the same assertion
failure even with my simple random latency hack.  So it is something
weird in our code for sure.  The really strange thing is that it
initially hit the assertion after something like 8.6B ticks, but when
I turned tracing on it hit it after only 9M ticks.  For tracing to
affect the simulation like that I'm guessing it's some kind of bad
pointer or memory allocation bug.  I'm running under valgrind now but
haven't turned up anything yet.
I'll keep you posted...

Yea, that makes sense.
