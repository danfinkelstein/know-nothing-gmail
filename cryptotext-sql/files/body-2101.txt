Hello:
I have to differentiate the different buses, such as tol2bus or
physmem bus... . I think that the best way to do this is create a new
parameter in the src/mem/Bus.py file and after in my configuration
file I give to this parameter the value that I want. But the think
that I do not know is how is the connection between the c++ files and
the python files done, I think that in somewhere the c++ files need to
read the configuration file and then get the parameters, can anyone
tell me how is this process done? I have not been able to find the
code.
Thanks.
