Hello,
I'm new to m5 and I Â wanted to install it on my scientific linux
distribution to use it for my PhD. Unfortunately I had a compile error,
it sais: "'$self' was not declared in this scope". This error occures at
lines 2899 and 2902 of build/SPARC_SE/python/swig/event_wrap.cc.
Is there anyone who can help me out?
Some version information about installed programs needed for m5:
