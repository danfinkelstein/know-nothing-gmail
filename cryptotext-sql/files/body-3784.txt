After going through and changing python parameters references to use the "const <object>Params *p" format in the constructor, and removing the preprocessor python things at the bottom of the file, I'm getting the following compile error:
g++ -o build/ALPHA_SE/params/params_wrap.o -c -pipe -fno-strict-aliasing -Wall -Wno-sign-compare -Werror -Wundef -g -O3 -DTHE_ISA=ALPHA_ISA -DTRACING_ON=1 -Iext/dnet -I/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/include/python2.4 -Ibuild/libelf -Ibuild/ALPHA_SE build/ALPHA_SE/params/params_wrap.cc
cc1plus: warnings being treated as errors
build/ALPHA_SE/params/params_wrap.cc: In member function ‘swig::PySequence_Ref<T>::operator T() const [with T = int]’:
build/ALPHA_SE/params/params_wrap.cc:3217: warning: ‘v’ may be used uninitialized in this function
scons: *** [build/ALPHA_SE/params/params_wrap.o] Error 1
scons: building terminated because of errors.
Can anyone shed some light on what may be going wrong here? The simulator compiled fine before I tried to transfer over this custom object, but I'm not familiar with swig so am unsure how to go about finding the source of this problem.
