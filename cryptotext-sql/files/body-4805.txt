Hi All,     I have started using M5 recently and i am trying to modify it for supporting transactional memory management.     Right now i have simple cpu model and only 1 processor during simulation and i am booting linux in it.     I am trying to understand how exactly m5 handles context switching between threads by running a multithreaded program.     My question is: When Linux decides to deschedule a thread and start executing another thread, exactly where in the M5 code all registers get saved?     -Thanks  uday
