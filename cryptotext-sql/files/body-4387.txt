Hi Jiayun,
The assert is wrong, we fixed it in our tree a while ago but haven't released a new version yet. Change the assert to:
assert(rm >= 0 && rm < 4);

Hi all,
When I am running a multithreaded benchmark on a multicore structure on M5, I encountered an assertion failure in the following function. Can you give me any hints on what this function does and how might this failure occur?
Thanks!
Jiayuan
src/base/fenv.c
void m5_fesetround(int rm)
{
 Â  Â assert(rm > 0 && rm < 4);
 Â  Â fesetround(m5_round_ops[rm]);
}
