That should be fine.

I don't imagine you configured the kernel or copied the .config.m5
to .config (assuming you're using our linux-patches repository).

I recommend you get a newer kernel 2.6.18 or 2.6.22 and use the linux
patches repository on it. Either way the problem current seems to be
that the kernel wasn't configured, __IO_PREIX should get replaced by
something like generic_ or tsunami_ if the kernel is configured
correctly.
