M5 can run pthreads binaries in full-system mode, which means you're
restricted to Alpha for now.
There are directions on building a gcc-based cross compiler here:
http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Using_linux-dist_to_Create_Disk_Images_and_Kernels_for_M5
Note that you just need to follow the first section (on building the
cross compiler); the other parts on building a new kernel are
unnecessary if you're just compiling new applications.
