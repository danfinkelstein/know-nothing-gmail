Hello,
I have checked out the instructions of using linux-dist to
create disk images. However, it doesn't mention how to
add my own benchmark instead of the default benchmarks
(netperf).
Let's say I have a simple helloworld.c file, and want to use
linux-dist to compile and add it to the disk image. How can
I do it?  Thanks.
Xin
