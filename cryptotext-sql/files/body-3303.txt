Have you read the paper by Alameldeen and Wood on this?  (There may have been other coauthors.)  They introduced variability by making the memory latency pseudo-random.Steve2008/4/9 Geoffrey Blake <blakeg@umich.edu>:

I'm potentially looking for some ways to induce some
non-determinism into multiprocessor setups for M5, since currently M5 is
completely deterministic. Does anyone have any suggestions where I should start
looking to be able to do this?  I'd like to measure the variance for
threaded programs over many runs.
 
I'm thinking the best place to induce non-determinism
is in bus.cc, or to even perhaps randomly shuffle the event queue for events
that need to launch on the same tick.
Thanks,
Geoff
