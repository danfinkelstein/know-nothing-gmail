   I have been looking into using M5 to run some full system disk IO
tests by expanding the disk model, (I believe it currently using a
flat timing model). M5 initially looks like a very good option since
it was developed with IO in mind (I read "The M5 Simulator: Modeling
Networked Systems") and it is open source.
   I have spent a fair amount of time looking though the documentation
and source code (for the full system alpha) and it seems to me that
the disk model could be made more accurate by replacing the flat
access time with a realistic access time.
  My question is, do you think modeling the access time more
accurately will allow M5 to properly model disks or are there other
caveats in different parts of the system, like the IDE controller and
PCI system, that will mess up my plans in ways I cannot foresee?
Essentially, I am afraid there could be a timing issue that I didn't
pick up on that would mess up my plan so I wanted to know that the
experts thought.
