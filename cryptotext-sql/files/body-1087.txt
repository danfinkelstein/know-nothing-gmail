If you know what tick the benchmark starts at, just don't begin your traceflagging until that point (i.e. --trace-start=Tick)Lisa- Show quoted text -On Mon, Aug 3, 2009 at 9:22 AM, Sujay Phadke <sphadke@eecs.umich.edu> wrote:

Hello,
  I am trying to collect memory traces running 
specweb in FS mode. However, if I use the traceflags to collect traces (say 
MemoryAccess), it starts collecting all memory requests, including the OS 
booting up. I want to collect only when the benchmark start running. How do I do 
this.?
 
Thanks,
Sujay
