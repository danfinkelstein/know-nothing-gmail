Hi, Nate. Thank you for your reply. Do you mean that the event instance number will remain the same in the next run? I think there are so many schedule function in M5, how can I schedule a breakpoint to intercept the event I want? Thank you very much!

In debug and opt mode, events have a unique instance number.  You can
figure out the instance number and then run again scheduling a
breakpoint when the event matching the instance number is scheduled.
The only other alternative involves hacking code.
