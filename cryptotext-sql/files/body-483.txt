I could boot solaris in SPARC_FS, but m5 exited abruptly after that
with the following message:
Exiting @ cycle 9223372036854775807 because simulate() limit reached
The command line I executed was:
build/SPARC_FS/m5.opt -v -d /tmp/output/ configs/example/fs.py
Host system: Ubuntu 32 bit
I tried it twice, and it quit at the same cycle count both the times.
To ascertain whether the error was caused because of something I did,
I didn't enter anything on the solaris terminal the second time. i.e.
The computer was idle for the entire duration except for the boot
command on opb. Has anyone run into a similar error? Or any hints
regarding debugging this?
