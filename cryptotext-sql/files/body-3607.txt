Often there are two types of special IPRs or memory regions (or ASIs
in SPARC land): one that says "flush the cache line (if any) that
matches this address" and another that says "flush the contents of the
cache line at this physical index into the cache array".  So a generic
cache flush would be a loop over the N lines in the cache using the
second type of access, while if you're manually trying to keep a
particular location coherent you might use the first type of access.
