(1) In FS mode, it's the Linux kernel running on the simulated machine
that's doing the thread scheduling, so that's where you have to
control CPU assignment.  For example, you can use sched_setaffinity()
.  This has been covered before on the mailing list, I think... maybe
someone should put it on the wiki (if it's not there already).
(2) I don't know why you're getting a segfault; there's no way to tell
without at least a stack backtrace.  Note that the other messages you
showed are warnings, not errors, so they're probably not related.
