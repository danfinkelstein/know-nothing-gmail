The L2 bus should have a mem_side port which connects to the L2, which should receive the packet on its cpu_side port. If you turn on the trace-flag "Config", all ports and their peers should show up at the beginning of simulation so you can see how everything is hooked up.

Hi, We found out that in the cache_impl.hh, if there is a miss, it calls sendatomic through memsideport - testsys.cpu.icache-mem_side_port, which in turn calls recvatomic through the peer port - testsys.tol2bus-p1 which is the bus. We are not able to understand the flow of the packet after this, how does the bus connect and send the packet to the L2?
