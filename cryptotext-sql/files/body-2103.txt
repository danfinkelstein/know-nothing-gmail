Hi,
I am also new to this simulator. I will try to answer according to the things
that I have found so far (please correct if I mentioned anything wrong). In M5
all the component are written in c++ and python act as a wrapper for the c++
classes.We write the configuration in python using these wrapper python classes.
The big comment in the following file describes this.
src/python/m5/SimObject.py
regarding the buses, membus, tol2bus are just names.they all are busses. what
you have to do is first identify the components you need to build your
system.then interconnect them using buses.
(please correct me if I am wrong.)
following forum post
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.m5.users/3482 and the help from the
user who posted the item and then taking the se.py as a base, writing your own
configuration helped me understand this.
regards,
Isuru
