Hi, all, when the fs.py making a LinuxAlphaSystem which it invoke a function makeLinuxAlphaSystem in FSConfig.py, there is a bridge connecting membus and iobus.  But in fs.py, the cache is connected directly to membus, so where is the bridge ?  Sorry for such silly question, but it really confuse me. Thanks !
