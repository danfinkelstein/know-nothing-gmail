I think the audio is more important than the video, so it would probably be fine.

Believe it or not, I still have one of those old lipstick-type iChat video cameras that you can point at stuff. It's nowhere near the quality of a dedicated digital camera, but if you want I can bring it along and try to capture the tutorial on video.
The more I think about it, the more futile my suggestion seems purely for quality consideration. I wonder it's worth posting to the list that if someone is attending ASPLOS and the M5 tutorial and has a digital video camera, can they bring it and record the session...
