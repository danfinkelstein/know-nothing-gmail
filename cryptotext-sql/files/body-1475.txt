No, you are not being very clear at all.  Be precise.  What *exactly*
are you changing?

This isn't clear.  What did you change?  Just the size of the cache?
Nothing about the block size?  Are you changing the block size at all
in the ones that are failing?  What are you changing in the runs that
are failing?

You have to give a better bug report if you want help.  Before you
sent us your configuration and all we saw was that you were changing
the block size so that it was not all the same for all caches.  THIS
IS NOT ALLOWED.  Other than that, we have no clue what exactly you're
doing.
I'm sorry, but we're getting very frustrated at your lack of a
detailed bug report.  Read this article about giving bug reports
before you try again:
