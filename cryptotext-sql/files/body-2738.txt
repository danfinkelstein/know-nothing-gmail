The problem is that some of the regressions in the stable directory
require some outside files which you don't have.  When we our previous
releases, we would remove those which we knew wouldn't work, but now
that we're releasing our repository, we need to fix our regression
framework to not error out in such cases.
You ought to be able to run:
scons build/ALPHA_SE/tests/debug/quick
All of the quick regressions to my knowledge work.  (Though, the eio
regression will fail if you don't compile in the encumbered bits.)
