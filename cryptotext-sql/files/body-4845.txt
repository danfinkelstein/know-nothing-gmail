Hi,Until now i did my simulations for CMP and SMT processor models with m5.But for a knew topic that I would like to research I have to be able tomeasure things like power consumption and die area as well. Does anyone
know if someone has made such "plugins" or subsets for m5 to measurethis, or are there some good tools that I could use that can do the job?Thanks_______________________________________________
