Hi all,
I have a question about how to bypass the packet in the L2 cache.  For
example, when L2 cache receives the packet from L1 cache, it will
bypass this packet to the Memory bus.  I am think about redirecting
the packet in the CpuSidePort::recvTiming() function. What is the best
way to write the packet into the MemSidePort directly and schedule
this event?
Thanks,
Meng-Ju
