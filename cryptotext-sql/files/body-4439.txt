Hi Aqeel,
The reason that this is happening is the version of libc that you compiled against from that Alpha workstation requires a 2.6.X kernel and the syscall emulation portion of the simulator reports itself as having 2.4.X version. That is the panic message is being reported from the libc you compiled against. You could either compile with a older version of libc or try to change the version reported in src/arch/alpha/linux/process.cc to 2.6.something. I don't know what other changes the syscall interface underwent when this happened, so to make it work you may have to implement some new syscalls or change some other things.

Hello,
I am having trouble running programs in SE mode.  I compiled a binary on an Alpha workstation running Gentoo linux, with kernel 2.6.21 and gcc 4.1.  When I run the binary in m5, I get the following output:

Can anyone help me fix this?
