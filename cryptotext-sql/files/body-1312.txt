Hi Gulay, thanks for your suggestion. IPR_PALtemp23 is sufficient for my current work. As my work may not limit on Alpha architecture in the future, so I have to find out something unique for every thread on other platforms. But right now, it works quite well. Thanks very much !

Hi Veydan,
Is it enough to have some unique id belongs to each thread. For example is it enough to use a MiscRegister like IPR_PALtemp23 register value which is unique for each thread.
Regards
Gulay
