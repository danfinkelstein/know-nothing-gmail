Hello I have a couple of questions regarding the instructions counter
that are in the statistics
My post is related with this one
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.m5.users/3324/focus=3328,
I have read it but I still have some questions.
- What is this value,  system.cpu0.num_insts    2    # Number of
instructions executed? and why is so low?. For all my CPUs I have a
similar low number.
- What is the difference between system.cpu0.num_insts   and
system.switch_cpus0.num_insts?
- What is commit.COM:loads?, is the number of accesses to the memory?
And I think that's all for now. Thanks in advance
