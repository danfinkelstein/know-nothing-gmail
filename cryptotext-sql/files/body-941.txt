Hi,     I am a graduate student who is trying to do some research on the M5 simulator . Now I am trying to use the SPEC2K Command Lines (Syscall Emulation) to run statically-linked ,Alpha program .The version I am using is m5-2.0b5. And the command is like this : $ build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug configs/example/se.py --cmd=eon00 --options="chair.control.cook chair.camera chair.surfaces chair.cook.ppm ppm pixels_out.cook" . So my question is how can construct the command to run multicore and switch the spec2000 tests between the cores .    
 
Best  regards !
Hao Cao
