For your fetch policy question,
I'm unsure why you arent getting a error for bogus input.
If you look in src/cpu/o3/fetch_impl.hh, you'll see that there should
be a "fatal()" after the SMT string is compared through the "policy"
variable.
Because that code is there, I question if your configuration is
exactly correct. Try turning on the "Fetch" trace flag and see what is
getting set at tick 0.
