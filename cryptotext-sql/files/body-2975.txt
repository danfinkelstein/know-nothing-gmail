Hi,
Â 
I am trying to port some application written
with pthread and OpenMP library on to M5 FS simulator.
However, the documentation mentioned that
the crosstool do not support gcc 4.
Could I use other cross compiler which support
gcc 4.2 to compiler these application into ALPHA executable to run in FS mode?
Or if I can find a alpha machine (or
virtual machine) to do the compilation work?
Thanks a lot~
