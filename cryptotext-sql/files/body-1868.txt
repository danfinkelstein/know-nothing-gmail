Hi, Ali, you are right. There is not /dev/ttyS0 on the stage image. How can I add that to the image? Is there any way to solve this? I hope I don't have to create an image myself.
I would guess that there isn't a /dev/ttyS0 on the disk image. I don't
know what is in the stage 3 image as far as dev inodes go, but it
should be populated with approximately what is in the image we
distribute.
