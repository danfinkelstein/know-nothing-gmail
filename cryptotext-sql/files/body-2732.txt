Hi all,
Is it possible to put m5ops into a binary that is being simulated in m5
full system? In this case, I want very accurate timing of a getpid, and
want to do resetstats, the system call, and then dump stats. So it would
be nice if I could put these calls into a binary without actually
inacting the system call utility to call the m5 binary.
