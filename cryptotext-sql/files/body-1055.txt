I see that but what I am trying to accomplish here is when you have multiple memory object types (caches and bridges), how to selectively register some ports as snoop. Ofcourse, I will have to make bridges etc coherent or change their functionality to ignore certain packets. In particular, say I have memsideports of all l2 caches, cpusideport of l3 and two bridgeports connected to a bus. when a packets hits the bus i want all l2s to snoop, packet be sent to l3 and bridges simple return true from recvTiming. Do you have something in mind how to automate it in current bus implementation.
