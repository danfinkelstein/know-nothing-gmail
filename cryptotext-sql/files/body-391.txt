Hi, all. I am new to the M5 ALPHA FS mode. I wonder how the first event ( tickEvent ) be inserted into the mainEventQueue. It seems that the simulate() is called right after the phthon function, I cannot find the code where the tickEvent inserted into the mainEventQueue before the simulated() is called. Could anybody give me a hint on this? Thank in advance.
