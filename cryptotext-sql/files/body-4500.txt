Hey all,
 
Quick question, how do assign the main thread to a 
specified cpu(core) in a multi-core configuration?  I notice that for 
each process, threadcontext[0] will be used as the main thread. However, it 
seems to be undeterministic to specify which cpu gets this threadcontext[0]. I 
am now using a heterogeneous configuration, with a control cpu and several slave 
cpus, and I want the main thread assigned to the control cpu. However, no matter 
how I changed the order in which the cpus are defined and used in the python 
script, it's always a slave cpu that gets threadcontext[0]. 
 
Thanks!
