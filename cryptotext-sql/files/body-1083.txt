Hello,Thank you for your response.Sorry, I am a bit inexperienced when it comes to M5, could anyone elaborate on the following:A possible reason you're getting a bad addr would be that Linux is
looking for a device were none exists. It could also be that address
translation is going wrong for some reason and it's accessing junk
addresses instead of physical memory.How would I be able to confirm the errors coming from the above two situations (if the error is serious I am guessing its from these two situations)? Any hints or advice is appreciated!

Judging by the segfault, you're using an earlier version of M5 that
didn't handle unconnected ports very gracefully. In the versions in the
stable and unstable repositories a port will be connected to a
default/dummy peer. If you ever try sending something to that peer, it
will complain at you instead of segfaulting.

If possible, I would recommend updating to the stable repository. This
problem may already be fixed, and if you haven't introduced any new bugs
it may just start working.
