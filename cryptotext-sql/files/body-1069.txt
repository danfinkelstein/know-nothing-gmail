If you look through src/mem/cache/cache_impl.hh, you'll see that all
of the places that once had pkt->req->threadId() as an index for
per-thread stats are hardwired to 0 now.  To be honest I don't
remember the reason for that (it was almost three years ago that that
happened, according to mercurial), but it probably had something to do
with dealing with requests that don't have a thread ID.
If you really need per-thread cache stats, you can try changing all
those indexes back and see if that works.  If someone else has already
done this, please speak up.  If someone gets it to work robustly, it
would be great to fix that in the repository.
