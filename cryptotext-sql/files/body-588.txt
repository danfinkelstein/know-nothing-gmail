  
Hey,
I wanted to specify the problem a little bit further and I found this:
After applying the patch:
When setting the latency of the IL1 cache at 0.5ns and the Physical
Memory's latency at 30ns I can run the simulation for latencies of the
L2-cache in the range ]0, 8.5] ns.
When I keep the L2 latency at 2ns I can change the Memory's latency to
a latency in the range ] 0, 43] ns.
When I keep L2's latency at 1ns I can change the Memory's latency to a
latency in the range ]0, 45] ns.
Without the patch I get similar results, though somewhat different:
IL1 latency=0.5ns; Memory latency=30ns => "valid" L2 latency in
]0;5.5 ns]
IL1 latency=0.5ns; L2 latency=2ns => "valid" Memory latency in
]0;37.5ns]
IL1 latency=0.5ns; L2 latency=1ns => "valid" Memory latency in
]0;39.5ns]
Best regards,

Hi,
  
My first experiences the patch:
M5 quits for the same configurations as before (IL1 latency = 0.5ns; L2
cache), but the error changes. In fact I don't get any error message
but I reached the maximum execution time after less than a second:
  
Exiting @ cycle 9223372036854775807 because simulate() limit reached
  
It's okay, I can wait until Monday :-).
Thanks for helping me!

  Max,
please try the recvRetry patch out and let us know how it goes.
    
In my repository, I currently am changing cache sizes and adjusting
latencies in my simulations w/out the problems you specify. However, I
have something time-sensitive for Monday and will need to wait until
Tuesday to work on cleaning up any "scruff" in the patches and
committing them.
    
If you really need it before then, I could zip-up some patches and send
you the mercurial "series" file and you can try that as well. Of
course, the downside to that is that when I do make changes to the
patches and commit to the tree you'll potentially have some merging of
code to do the next time you update from the dev branch.

patch. I never got around to testing it properly. It it
highly likely that would have to make the changes manually. But it is
a pretty small patch.
