The -ve number was an issue with something else ! However, if I add busCycles, the traces are what is expected. But if I insert processor cycles e.g., tickNextIdle+=78, the traces are not in accordance with what is expected and even the total numebr of cycles are less than without adding extra cycles. I am looking for the right way to insert processor cycles (ticks rather than numCycles) for a certain packet?

>I want to have extra bus cycles added for certain type of packets. If I add a busCycle, tickNextIdle+=clock, something anomalous happens. At one point after first 4000 cycles, the tickNextIdle gets calculated to a negative number, which the following trace on bus shows: Please suggest whats the right way to add busCycles. If I add processor cycles (tickNextIdle+=100), I dont have negative numbers but the traces show results not expected !
