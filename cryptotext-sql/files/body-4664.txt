Hi Steve,
I have re-checked the SWIG installation - which as shown below says its
complete. New errors when I am trying to build the M5 Beta2:
Installing /local/sharookh/m5-2.0b2/share/swig/1.3.31/std/std_wstring.i
Installing /local/sharookh/m5-2.0b2/share/swig/1.3.31/std/std_carray.swg
Installation complete
sharookh@myra /local/sharookh/m5-2.0b2/swig-1.3.31 $ cd ..
sharookh@myra /local/sharookh/m5-2.0b2 $ ./bin/scons build/ALPHA_FS/m5.debug
scons: Reading SConscript files ...

Please help.
