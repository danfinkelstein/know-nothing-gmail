Tracy,
Why don't you give us your command line, important bits of your config files and the stats file to take a look at. Like the warning that is printed when you used the DRAM model says, it's largely untested, so something could be broken, but I don't think it's that broken.

Hi Ali,
   I was using AtomicSimpleCPU to run simulation for 1 billion instructions.
Now I change to use TimingSimpleCPU to run for 1 billion instructions. The
difference of average DRAM access latency is even higher(more than 40%),
but still 0% difference in sim_tick. Is that because 1 billion instruction
is not enough to see any changes?
   I don't find any memory access queue in full system. How this
calculated DRAM latency is used?
   In the code, this latency will be transfered to sendTiming(pkt,
latency), and this function will call SimpleTimingPort::SendEvent(this,
pkt, time);
Will the latency be used in the mainEventQueue?
Thanks,
Tracy
There are two possibilities.
a) You were running for a set number of ticks, so you wouldn't see
any change in sim_ticks because the number of ticks was controlling
the length of the simulation.
b) You were using the AtomicSimpleCPU instead of either the
TimingSimpleCPU or the O3CPU, so the DRAM latency wasn't being
accounted for.

Hi,
   I implement different page allocation algorithms(virtual to
physical
address translation algorithm) based on current DRAM model in full
system(m5_2.0b). After running simulations(benchmark is ValStream), I
could see more than 20% difference in average DRAM access latency
within all these algorithms, but almost 0% difference in sim_ticks.
   Is that because the caculated dram latency is not used? Can anybody
explain that to me?
   Thanks.
Tracy
