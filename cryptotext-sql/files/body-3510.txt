Is it possible to run a multiprogram simulation with more than 128 cores? Using a slightly modified se.py and running in simple timing mode, I've tried to run the hello world default benchmark on 129 cores, and it never gets past the "starting simulation" message. For 128 cores it runs fine (including printing out the "warning: increasing stack size by one page" message, but the moment I go above 128 I never see that warning and it hangs.
On the other hand, running in atomic simple cpu mode it completes for even 256 cores.
This is using an unmodified m5 2.0b4 source. Does anyone know what may be causing this issue, and if there is a way to get around it? Or how I may go about tracing the problem down? I'm not sure what all steps occur between the "starting simulation" message and when the programs get loaded (which I assume causes the stack size increase), but that's when the simulator appears to get stuck.
Thanks,
Nick
