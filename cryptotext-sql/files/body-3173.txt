The max_insts* parameters are per-cpu, so you have to make sure they're set for all the cpus in the system (most easily done by setting it on the base cpu class).Â  Possibly in the script you're using the command-line argument is only setting the parameter on one cpu.

What is the proper way of using multiple programmes using m5. Currently, I use fast forward at command line and set max-inst, but the benchmarks run for much longer than that. If I use max_insts_all_threads, I have the same problem. For MP workloads looks like there is not much control for specifying particular no. of instructions which makes compariosn a bit tough. When I interrupt the simulation using sigintp, sometimes statistics are printed but otherwise the job exists rather than done.
What is the correct way of running multiple programmes using m5?
