In the past people have hacked such things in, but there isn't presently a way to do that. To introduce generic support for such a thing you would need to do something like extending the AddrRange class (and updating all associated member functions). I believe that would break the RangeMap class pretty badly (which most memory devices that need to sort out multiple ranges use to do so).
If the interleaving was only being done at a certain level you could create a bus bridge type device that would take care of the ugliness for you. If you want general support it would take a bit more work.

Is there presently a way to interleave the address ranges of a set of memory devices? If not, what is the opinion on extending the AddrRange class to incorporate a stride field? Would this break certain objects in subtle ways? Obviously, the stride would have to be at at least the granularity of the smallest memory request (in the absence of further changes).
