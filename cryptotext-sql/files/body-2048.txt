Yes there is you can use the sched_setaffinity syscall to bind a
specific program to a CPU core. The newest m5 in simulator binary
(what is in util/m5/ in the source tree) supports ./m5 pin <cpu to pin
to> <program to pin to cpu> <program arguments>. However, the disk
image that we provide has an older version of libc that doesn't
support this syscall. You'll need to use a newer disk image such as
the one that comes with gentoo.
