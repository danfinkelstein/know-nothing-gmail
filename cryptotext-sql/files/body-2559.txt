Hi,
 
Given a physical address of a word i want to find out the complete cache-line. Meaning i want to find out the lowest address and highest address of the word which is mapped to that cache line.
Now one easiest apporach is to just find out the nearest multiples of 64byte(cache line size) above and below that address.. Will that be sufficient and correct all the time?
