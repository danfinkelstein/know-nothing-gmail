I should clarify that full-system isn't supported for *SPARC* in our out-of-order model (it does work for syscall emulation), and it could work with full-system, but some of the ASI nastiness would have to be handled. Our out-of-order model simulates Alpha full-system just fine.
So to clarify your earlier statement, does full system work for a "SPARC" in order model? Â That is to say, it's using SPARC binaries?
Maybe if you haven't had a need to do a full system test in OO mode, then it might not be so critical...- Show quoted text -
