Hi Vilas,
If anything is released in the near future it won't be a major change to an underlying subsystem (e.g. the big cache change in b4).

Hi m5 developers --
Just a quick question: do you happen to know whether another release of m5 will be forthcoming in the near future?  I'm using v2.0b2, and I have made a number of modifications that it will take me a while to port to a new release.  If there's another release imminent ( i.e. within the next month), I will wait, but otherwise I'll port over to using v2.0b4.
Thanks,
    -Vilas
