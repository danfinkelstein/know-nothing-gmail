    This is partially true. You can make portage (the Gentoo package
manager) use whatever gcc you want, including a cross compiler. Some
packages will get upset, though, if they can't run code they compiled.
This is particularly the case with configure scripts which test to make
sure your gcc can build functioning executables. There is a group within
Gentoo that's pushing to fix these issues in order to, for example, make
Gentoo more practical for embedded devices, but I don't think they've
gotten to far. If someone out there knows that I'm wrong and can tell us
how to make it work in all cases, we'd definitely like to know.
