hello, everybody,
I met some problems
I  ran benchmarks on m5 ALPHA SE mode.
int bus.cc , I wanted to get the details of a pkt in " bool Bus::recvTiming(PacketPtr pkt)" , and I called from the " packet.hh "  the function " int Request::getCpuNum()".  if a pkt contains "Writeback" instruction , the simulation would be terminated and it would get the following error message:
// error message ///////////////////////////////////////
0: system.remote_gdb.listener: listening for remote gdb #0 on port 7008
0: system.remote_gdb.listener: listening for remote gdb #1 on port 7009
warn: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...
warn: Increasing stack size by one page.
warn: Increasing stack size by one page.
m5.opt: build/ALPHA_SE/mem/request.hh:261: int Request::getCpuNum(): Assertion `validCpuAndThreadNums' failed.
Program aborted at cycle 21498000
// error message //////////////////////////////////////
but I need to collect the unformation even when the pkt has "Writeback" instruction.
could anybody kindly tell me how to use getCpuNum() , getThreadNum() and getPC() without errors? or are there some other ways?
thank you very much in advance
York
