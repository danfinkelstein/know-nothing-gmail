We didn't write the trace reader.  It came from simplescalar and the
license isn't very friendly so we don't include it in our
distribution.

You're completely right and we've long had an item on our todo list to
improve our regression system so these tests aren't run in this
situation.

You're right, it doesn't have the input files.  In the output
directory for the test, you can look at the stdout and stderr files to
find out more information abotu why a test failed.

Not all tests faile, but only the ones for which you don't have input
files.  All of the tests based on SPEC2000 require input files and
binaries which we can't redistribute because of license issues.
Again, we need to fix our test system so these don't run.
I apologize for the troubles you're having.
