hi all, 
i 've add my spm(sram) model into m5 recently, what i need to do next is to redirect the original access to cache to my spm as a substitute. i 've modified some files such as /src/cpu/o3/lsq.cc(.hh), but i don't know if dcache elsewhere are essential to be noted in my work? 
how can i do my spm access redirect then?thanks a lot.-- RegardsDengningSchool Of Computer Science and Technology Beijng Institute of Technology, China, 100081dunning2006@gmail.com
