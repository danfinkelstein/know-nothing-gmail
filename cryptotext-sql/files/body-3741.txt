Hi all,
   I met some problems by using Stats:Formula.
Here is my code :
   enum MemAccessType {
       MemRead,         // reads
       MemWrite,                // writes
       MemOther,                // unknown
       MEM_ACCESS_NUM
   };
   Stats::Vector<> statAccessReceived;
   Stats::Formula statAccessTotalReceived;
    statAccessReceived
        .init(MEM_ACCESS_NUM)
        .name(name() + ".access_received")
        .flags(pdf | dist)
        ;
    for (int i = 0; i < MEM_ACCESS_NUM; i++) {
        stringstream ss_name, ss_desc;
        ss_name.width(10);
        ss_name << "" << memAccessNameStr[i];
        ss_desc << "received " << memAccessDescStr[i];
        statAccessReceived.subname(i, ss_name.str());
        statAccessReceived.subdesc(i, ss_desc.str());
    }
   statAccessTotalReceived
        .name(name() + ".access_total_received")
        .desc("total recevied memory accesses")
        .flags(total)
        ;
         statAccessTotalReceived = statAccessReceived[MemRead] +
                              statAccessReceived[MemWrite] +
                              statAccessReceived[MemOther];
When I compiled the code, I got this error message:
build/ALPHA_FS/base/statistics.hh: In member function āstd::string
Stats::ScalarProxy<Stat>::str() const [with Stat =
Stats::VectorBase<Stats::StatStor>]:
build/ALPHA_FS/base/statistics.hh:2000:   instantiated from std::string

scons: *** [build/ALPHA_FS/mem/sdram/sdram_ctrl.o] Error 1
Does anyone know what is the problem?
Thanks,
Rongrong Lai
