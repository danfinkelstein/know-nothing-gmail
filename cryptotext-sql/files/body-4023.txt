1)The BaseCpu.py object has the following function in both version beta 2 and beta 3:
def addTwoLevelCacheHierarchy(self, ic, dc, l2c):
        self.addPrivateSplitL1Caches(ic, dc)
        self.toL2Bus = Bus()
        self.connectMemPorts(self.toL2Bus)
        self.l2cache = l2c
        self.l2cache.cpu_side = self.toL2Bus.port
        self._mem_ports = ['l2cache.mem_side']
Do you still think beta 3 doesnot support or above funstion doesnot create private two level hierarchy?
2) Do you think m5 is good to do interconnect research?To meaure the increase in traffic on the shared bus,network congestion etc.
