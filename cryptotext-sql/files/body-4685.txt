Nathan,I'm not sure that UnaryNode needs to be changed...it currently calls op(l->total()), which seems to be the right thing to do, assuming the underlying total() function does the right thing (which it should).  Right?
Anyway, I've attached the diff of the BinaryNode total() function.  It seems to work correctly for me.   -Vilas- Show quoted text -On 3/5/07, Nathan Binkert

UnaryNode call result() and then sum the values.  If you can give that ashot and send a diff, that'd be great.   Nate_______________________________________________m5-users mailing list
