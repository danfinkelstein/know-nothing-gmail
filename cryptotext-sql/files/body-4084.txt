Hi,
I have compiled a cross compiler(gcc3.4.3-glibc2.3.5),but got
stuck in compiling linux 2.6.13 kernel. I have download
linux-2.6.13.tar.gz from kernel.org. Unpack it and in the
linux-2.6.13 directory, type the following:
make config ARCH=alpha CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/crosstool/gcc-3.4.3-
glibc-2.3.5/.../alpha-unknown-linux-gnu-
After configuration, type the following to compile the kernel:
make ARCH=alpha CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/crosstool/gcc-3.4.3-
glibc-2.3.5/.../alpha-unknown-linux-gnu-
But I got the error below:
local symbol 0: discarded in section '.exit.text'....
Could you tell me how you compiled(linux2.6.13?) and got the sample vmlinux?
Another question: Is it necessary to compile linux kernel for
anyone using the m5 simulator? I mean, can I just build my own
disk image(contains my benchmark) and make it work with
the sample vmlinux? Thanks a lot.
Xin
