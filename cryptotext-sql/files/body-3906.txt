Impossible to guess on the segfault with so little information.
Just a note that if you're creating four LiveProcess objects, you're
really running four copies of radix, not running radix on four
processors.  This may or may not be what you want.

If you don't specify a workload for a processor, it will never do
anything, so there's no point in having it in the system.
If you're trying to reserve it to run an additional thread from a
parallel benchmark (like radix), then what you want to do is create a
single LiveProcess object and use that as the workload for *all* the
cpus that you want to run that instance of the program.
See the attached config files... I thought we distributed these with
the release, but it looks like we don't.  We should probably start
doing that.
