Hello All,I am still having an issue.  G++ is installed on my system, however when I run scons to compile M5, CXX does not get set and I have posted before on this issue and it is still not yet resolved.  Please advise.  I have no idea how to get G++ to set this variable.  
I have even tried to set this variable manually to $CXX=/usr/bin/g++  but this does not fix the error either.This is the error I am getting.  aswilli@aswilli-laptop:~/m5-stable$ scons build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debugscons: Reading SConscript files ...
