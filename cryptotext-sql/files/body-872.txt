In what way do you want to modify it? If you want to change what
microcode a macroop changes to or what microops are available, you can
do both those things. The microcode is in src/arch/x86/isa/insts/ is
processed by x86's ISA description. The microops are defined in
src/arch/x86/isa/microops. There's partial documentation for that
system on the wiki. If you want to fundementally change how macroops
are turned into microops (adding microop fusion, for instance), then
you still could but it would be significantly more work.
