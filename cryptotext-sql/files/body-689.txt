- Show quoted text -Hi everyone,I setup a new benchmark by copying the related alpha binary to the disk image and setting up the related scripts. This benchmark is a single threaded benchmark which does some very trivial math operations and repeat for 1000 times. I ran m5 with 8 processors to see how this benchmark performs. After simulation was done, I looked at the stats file generated by m5. I expected to see one (or maybe two) cpu with high instruction count and the rest kind of idle, but out of the 8 processors 5 of them had very high instruction count. Can someone explain to me why this happened for a single thread program?
Thanks,Amir
