Thank you for your reply.It is like nonuniform cache. When the L2 cache receives a different address request, It assigns a different latency. Which codes describe such kind of process?ThanksGary- Show quoted text -

I.e. you want to implement NUCA of some sort?  I don't anyone has
modeled this yet, so you'd have to hack on the cache model a bit.  I
honestly don't think this should be all that difficult to do depending
on how complicated your NUCA model is.
Anyone like to correct me?
