Hi all,
I want to implement this year's ISCA paper, "Reactive NUCA" in the M5
SE mode and compare the results with my research. Basically, the paper
is dynamically remapping the physical pages. After I change the TLB, I
need to write the dirty blocks back to main memory directly and set
the cache block to be invalid.
What is the best way to implement the writeback? Up to now, I think
the functional writeback without timing will be fine. Is there a
function in the cache_impl.hh can be used as an example to implement
this writeback function? If I check the dirty blocks in L1, then how
to write the blocks in L1 to memory directly?
Thanks,
Meng-Ju
