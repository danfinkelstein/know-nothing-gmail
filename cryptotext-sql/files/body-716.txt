Junli,Note that the wiki page describing using linux-dist has this caveat:"Note that this process is quite deprecated and not well supported. We suggest that you get your disk images either from the downloads page, or if that doesn't satisfy your needs, with a Gentoo stage 3 image. While we're not saying the below will not work, it may require a lot of massaging on your part."
We should probably make it bolder so it is more obvious to see.

Hi every one,I need a large disk image. I tried to compile a new image with linux-dist following the instructions on the m5 website.when I type: ptxdist go., it stops like this:...........
--  ftp://ftp.handhelds.org/packages/ipkg-utils/ipkg-utils-1.7.tar.gz           => `/home/junligu/shared/ptxworkspace2/src/ipkg-utils-1.7.tar.gz'
Resolving ftp.handhelds.org... 128.31.0.22Connecting to ftp.handhelds.org|128.31.0.22|:21... connected.Logging in as anonymous ...The process just does not move on. What's wrong?
I am confused with the step 1 and step 3: cd into that directory, and type: ptxdist menuconfig.
The default ptxconfig ought to be sufficient for everything, but you do
need to set one value. Find the Image Creation Options menu and ensure
that the "Path to kernel src" value points to your linux directory that
you got from us.//i set to the download path of linux-dist type: ptxdist toolchain /path/to/your/toolchain/bin (e.g. /opt/crosstool/gcc-3.4.3-glibc-2.3.5/alpha-unknown-linux-gnu/bin).  This ensures that in building all of the binaries you are using the appropriate toolchain.
 type: ptxdist menuconfig.  Note that you will have to go to the Image Creation Options option and set the path to the kernel code that you will be using for your headers and iscsi benchmark module compilation.//I set "Path to kernel src" to the installation path
 What should the path be separately? there are three paths, ont is the one of the download path, one is the installation path, and the other is the workspace path. Just confused with the setting of paths....
