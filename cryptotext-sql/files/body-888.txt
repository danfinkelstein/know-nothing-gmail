Hi all,
 
I have a problem running the simulation with 64 cores when I use the SimpleTimingCPU model with some benchmarks (for example, JPEG_encode). The simulation works fine with 48 cores, but when I increase the cores' number to 64 it appears the following message:
 
"Exiting @ cycle 9223372036854775807 because simulate() limit reached"
 
I searched the archive and found the solution to this problem in the O3CPU model (which is here http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.m5.users/2348), but I don't know how to fix this problem in the SimpleTimingCPU model. Does anyone know how to fix this problem?
 
Thanks in advance!
 
Fei
