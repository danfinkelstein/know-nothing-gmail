Hello Ali, you were right, I tried the workload in a non modified
installation and it was working right, finally I traced the error to
these lines that I added in the function recvTiming of bus.cc. I will
post the lines that were causing the problem, because maybe it is
helpful for someone in the future
int foo = pkt->getDest();
if (foo == -1) foo = 8;
My_counters[pkt->getSrc()][foo]++;
I deleted them and now it is working fine. And another question, to
debug the problem I was commenting and uncommenting the changes that I
did, I would like to ask, if it is possible in this type of errors use
gdb to see the lines that were causing the problem.
Thanks.
