Hi all:
I expect the following steps in full system simulation:
(1) boot linux with atomic cpu and create a checkpoint after linux is
booted.
(2) restore from this checkpoint into timing cpu and warm up cache num1
instructions
(3) switch to a detailed cpu and run num2 instructions
(4) record the result of the num2 instrutions
let simulator: m5.debug
config file: fs.py
benchmark: gzip
Can anyone tell me how to write a command to accomplish the above steps?
Thank you very much.
