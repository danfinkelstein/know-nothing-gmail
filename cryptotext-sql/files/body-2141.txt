Hello,
I have a system with 4 cpu and one L2 cache shared with all of the
cores, I am doing the simulations with the detail cpu. I am interested
in study how the cores access to the shared cache. I have been looking
in the code of mem/bus.cc and mem/bus.hh. In the file bus.cc there is
a function called  recvTiming, this is the function that is used to
access to the bus and when the bus is busy the accesses are stored in
a retryList, but my question is: is this the function used to access
to the shared cache? or it is used only to access to the main memory.
I have been printing the accesses in the retryList , but I do not see
enough access from the different cores, that's why I am thinking that
maybe that retryList is not the retryList for the shared cache.
And another question is there a way to assign a core per program in
full system mode, I know that is a linux question and not a M5
simulator problem, but I would like to know if anybody knows a way to
assign a program to each core.
Thank you.
