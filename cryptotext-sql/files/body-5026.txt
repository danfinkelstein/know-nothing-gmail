Friends,I was wondering how to disable the COW feature in the new version of m5.  I was able to disable this in the previous version so that I could make persistent changes to the disk, but I have been largely unsuccessful at setting up the configuration to allow me to create a normal disk with the new beta version.  I was wondering if anyone had the adjustment that needs to be made in the 
FSConfig.py to allow persisent disk changes from within the simulator, or point me to some documentation where I can find it?Thank you in advance,Fernando
