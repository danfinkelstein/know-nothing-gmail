Currently, the default output directory of m5 is the current working
directory.  Personally, I find that pretty annoying since I almost
never want M5 to litter the current working directory with output.
How do people feel about me making the default output directory
"./m5.out".  This could of course be overridden with the -d option as
usual.  I will also be creating a .m5rc in the near future where all
of these options can be easily set, so if people hate the idea I can
do it in my own .m5rc file.
