Hi all,
I have several questions about cache in M5:
1) First and most importantly, is it under developing to support different block sizes in different cache levels / cores? If not, is it possible to modify M5 to make it support this (and what is the estimating workload for this extension)?
2) MSHR (miss status holding registers) is not playing any role (or does not Â make any difference) in TimingSimpleCPU or InorderCPU, right?
3) system.cpu.numCycles has in-cooperated all the timing issue in memory hierarchy (cache, bus, memory) if the memory access mode is "timing", right?
Thanks.
