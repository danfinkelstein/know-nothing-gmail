There's another case that's interesting, which is the cache... it uses SimpleTimingPort but does not call recvAtomic to handle recvTiming.  The original purpose of SimpleTimingPort was to provide an easy way for devices that only support recvAtomic to also support recvTiming.  It turned out that even though the cache uses a more complex timing model for recvTiming(), there was still a bunch of code to schedule future responses that was duplicated between the cache and SimpleTimingPort, so at some point that code was refactored to let the cache use SimpleTimingPort even though it uses it in a slightly different fashion from other objects.

Not everywhere, but most places. The bus uses the port interface
directly without the SimpleTimingPort, however it doesn't derive from
port.  I'm not sure what a more detailed interface that derived from
Port would look like. If you assume that the device that uses the
SimpleTimingPort handles requests serially this model is fine, the
only issue is when there is contention within a device. If you read
the page on the wiki about the memory interface the port class
provides primitives for a more detailed implementation.
