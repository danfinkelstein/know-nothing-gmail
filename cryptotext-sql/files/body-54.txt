  
If you only need estimates for a few processors you don't need a parser
off course..
Just write one XML-template and fill in all the necessary parameters
manually.

Hi,
  
You could use McPAT for this and use the M5 statistics as input.
The catch is that you'll have to write a parser to parse the m5
statistics and configuration file.
The parser should then write the input for mcpat in the proper XML
format.
  
Good luck!

PS: I wrote such a parser, tailored for a simple in order core. It's
not general at all, but it could inspire you a bit.

  Hi,
I was wondering if it was possible to do any power estimation in M5.
Something similar to the way it is done in simplescalar?
    
Best,
Syed
