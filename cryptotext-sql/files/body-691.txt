1- Is there anyway for me to understand which core(or cores) my benchmark was running on?2- Do you think it's possible for the Linux scheduler to move the benchmark from one processor to another while it's running?
Thanks,Amir

Since you're running full system, it's probably because those processors are in an idle loop.  Check the user/kernel time stats.  However, why 5/8 would be high is unclear, I don't know why the last 3 wouldnt' also have a high count..

Hi everyone,I setup a new benchmark by copying the related alpha binary to the disk image and setting up the related scripts. This benchmark is a single threaded benchmark which does some very trivial math operations and repeat for 1000 times. I ran m5 with 8 processors to see how this benchmark performs. After simulation was done, I looked at the stats file generated by m5. I expected to see one (or maybe two) cpu with high instruction count and the rest kind of idle, but out of the 8 processors 5 of them had very high instruction count. Can someone explain to me why this happened for a single thread program?
Thanks,Amir
