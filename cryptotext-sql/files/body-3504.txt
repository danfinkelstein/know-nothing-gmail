Hi Dean,You can grab the binaries from here: http://cis.poly.edu/~dfinke01/spec/BTW, I'm having a killer time trying to get the SPEC benchmarks to run with the default inputs with ALPHA_SE. I've got my binaries and input files exactly the way they're supposed to be (Nate even sent me a listing of their file structure, and they match) so I think I'm doing something wrong...
I read your posts on the mailing list but I wonder if you've got a simple way to, say, run gcc with a regular input set (like 'ref').Thanks,Dan
