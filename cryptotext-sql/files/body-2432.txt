in cache_impl.hh, there are two functions, handleResponse and timingAccess, you should look for statements such as cpuSidePort->respond and change them with cpuSidePort[n].respond....Similarly if you want multiple ports on memory side, its not that difficult. Regarding which request goes to a given port, you can have another field in the packet cacheId, which gets set by the private cache in getBusTiming or getBusPacket (look cache_impl.hh)...and based upon that the shared bus can forward the request appropriate port. Implementing contention in cache_impl.hh should be fairly straightforward. You should also read the tutorial slides at m5 main page for adding more functionality. I dont know if adding more ports will help you much since currently caches are not banked.
