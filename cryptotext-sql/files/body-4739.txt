Hi,
 
I'm running some simulation on TCP/IP workload. And 
something unexpected happened to me. As we know, TCP will play fast retransmit 
when the sender receive 3 or more duplicate ACKs asap. However, on my 
observation, sometimes, when the sender see the duplicate ACKs, it will not 
trigger a fast retransmit, instead, a timeout is set up, which means it will 
take much longer time to complete the retransmission. I'm quite confused on 
this. I tracked the packets, and I'm sure that the duplicate ACKs successfully 
arrived at the sender side. As much as I know, such behavior of TCP is not 
reasonable. How is TCP implemented on M5?
 
Thanks,
Yu
