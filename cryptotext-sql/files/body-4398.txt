Hi,
 
I am attempting to add a new device to the
full system mode. But during initialization, src/mem/bus.cc Bus::recvStatusChange(Port::Status
status, int id) is called which sets the portId for all device ranges in
portList (including the new one) to 0. The result is that memory receives pio
access, because src/mem/bus.cc will recognize the address range, but the portId
is now zero which is physical memory. The new pio_address is beyond physical
memory so it is not clear why the memory is being assigned as the device for
all pio accesses. Any thoughts would be helpful.
 
Thanks,
Richard.
