Hi, I am using m5.opt and m5.debug  to run  FS simulation. ./build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt  configs/example/fs.py -b NetperfMaertsbuild/ALPHA_FS/m5.debug -d /tmp/output configs/example/fs.pybuild/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt --trace-flags="Cache" configs/example/fs.pyAnd, I  connect to the simulated console interface bym5term localhost 3456But, the console responds my typing very slowly.And,  I use ls and got : 	benchmarks  etc         lib         mnt         sbin        usr	bin         floppy      lost+found  modules     sys         var	dev         home        man         proc        tmp         zMy question is :Where are these directories located ? And, where is the linux kernel located ? If I want to implement a linux scheduling algorithm in a linux kernel.And, I plan to use linux-dist to Create Disk Images and Kernels for M5with compiled benchmarks.And then, I install the disk in the  directory:/dist/m5/systemAnd, when I run the benchmarks . How can I make sure that the threads generated from the benchmarks are scheduled by th new linux kernel ?thanks,Mike May.  7  2008  Get Free (PRODUCT) RED™  Emoticons, Winks and Display Pics.
