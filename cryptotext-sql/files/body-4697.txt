if it's something that came directly from busybox, it should play nice, but not always.  it would be helpful to see some stats and data.1) what kernel headers are you compiling against in linux-dist?
2) what kernel have you compiled?3) most importantly, what are your error messages?  lisa- Show quoted text -On 2/28/07, Brad Penoff <

able to build and boot disks using the same method successfully.The reason I wish to add env is because when I ran my series ofapplications, it complained that it didn't exist. So, there is this issue
of "why did the kernel panic?" but more generally, I seek advice for howto add in my own applications the proper way.  I'm guessing you haveexperience with this seeing as how you have so many advanced benchmarks
available within the default system.  Is there a list/person where Iwrite to ask about your experiences of getting complex applications to runinside m5?  Is this the right list to ask such questions?Thanks!
