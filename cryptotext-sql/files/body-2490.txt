The short answer is that there isn't one. If you look at (and re-
enable) the ThreadInfo printing work/m5/src/arch/alpha/linux/system.cc:
139. You can see how to get at thread information at any time. You can
use that to grab the statistics you want. However, you could probably
just compile into the pthreads program the m5 psuedo instructions for
resetting statistics and exiting the simulator. If you do that at the
start and finish of each run you'll get statistics your your
application + the kernel  which seems like a valid way to measure the
benchmark.
You can run up to 64 cores in FS mode. You can bind a thread to a
specific core in linux using the sched_setaffinity() system call.
However, some versions of the glibc library (including the ones on the
disk image we distribute) and the gcc 3.X series compiler we have on
our website do not support that system call. You'll need to create a
new disk image if you want to use it (or just get the gentoo
bootstrapping image) and use a gcc version 4.X compiler.
