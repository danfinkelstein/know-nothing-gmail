The IPL gets changed around (local_irq_disable(), local_irq_save()):
http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.33/arch/alpha/include/asm/system.h#L282
Which choses a software IPL level between 0 and 7. That value gets
changed to a CPU specific IPL in the palcode here:
http://repo.m5sim.org/alpha-system/file/54e0019e3b94/palcode/osfpal.S#l3011
by doing extracting the proper byte from the pt_intmask register that
is created here:
http://repo.m5sim.org/alpha-system/file/54e0019e3b94/palcode/platform.S#l1448
IPL_MAX in linux (7) corresponds to IPL 0x1f for the CPU.
