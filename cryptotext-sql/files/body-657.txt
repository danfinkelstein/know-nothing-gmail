Hello,
   I was going through the previous threads about fastforwarding
support, but couldnt get a clear answer. When we specify
--fast-forward=FF, is if FF ticks or FF instructions? If it is ticks,
then is there a new way for FF instructions?
As an aside, I am able to use --fast-forward with m5.fast. With m5.opt,
it crashes with the error:

Is there still the same bug about no valid threadcontext in o3?
