i am trying to use multiple FUPools, specifically in the instruction queue. So i doubled all instances and modified inst_queue a bit. I also doubled all FUPool declarations, specifically in Params.
I think I missed nothing in the C++ codes,  but  I don't know where to begin in modifying Python, I assumed that Python part would also have to be changed, since I'd be creating a new simobject. when i try to compile without modifying the python code
i tried changing the the file 03CPU.py
from
    fuPool = Param.FUPool(DefaultFUPool(), "Functional Unit pool")
to
    fuPool0 = Param.FUPool0(DefaultFUPool(), "Functional Unit pool")
    fuPool1 = Param.FUPool1(DefaultFUPool(), "Functional Unit pool")
any pointers, on how i could get my replication of FUPools reflected in the Python code? thanks
The syntax of the lines in the file are:
<parameter name> = Param.<parameter type>(<default if unassigned>, <string describing parameter)
So unless you've created two different classes called FUPool0 and FUPool1 you probably want:
    fuPool0 = Param.FUPool(DefaultFUPool(), "Functional Unit pool")
    fuPool1 = Param.FUPool(DefaultFUPool(), "Functional Unit pool")
