In FS mode, there are no 'workloads' in the sense of SE mode... each system boots exactly one OS kernel and then it's up to the OS kernel to schedule whatever threads get created above the OS (e.g., by your rc script).

Thank you for your quick response, Korey. I just verified that when I print out numThreads from cpu.cc it prints out 2.Although, I have another question for you now. When you say that number of threads in an SMT workload gets derived from the number
of workloads presented, is it true only for SE mode? Because in FS mode, we should be able to have (# workloads >= # h/w threads), right?regards,Soumyaroop.

Hi Soumyaroop,
The situation you describe is interesting. Something to note is that
the number of threads in an SMT workload gets derived from the number
of workloads presented not necessarily from the numThreads parameter
on the CPU.
I'm actually starting a revamp of the SMT regressions this week, so
stay tuned to the m5-dev list to see progress.
The discrepancy you make in the "numThreads=1" does seem confusing and
should be ironed out if possible.
