I don't know what you mean by version 5 (unless you mean 2.0b5), but
you should use the stable repo (or perhaps even the dev repo as it has
been pretty stable and we'll probably update stable sooner or later.)
As for ruby_se.py, there is an effort to integrate the Ruby memory
system from GEMS into M5.
