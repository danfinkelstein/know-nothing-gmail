The function works.  You can create whatever hierarchy you want in any
version of m5.  However, due to restrictions on the coherence
protocol, b3 and earlier versions will only function correctly with
two levels of private cache for uniprocessor systems.  If you have
private L1s and private L2s in a multiprocessor in b3 or earlier the
coherence protocol will fail.
The b4 release has a new coherence protocol that does not have this
restriction.  It is designed to support nearly arbitrary
configurations.  There are bugs that may cause it to fail in some more
exotic configurations, but private L1s with private L2s should work
fine.

Yes, but it won't do everything you want out of the box.  You'll have
to put some effort into modeling the exact platform(s) you want to
study.  I'm guessing that's true no matter what simulator you use.
