Hi Joe,
I think this is unrelated to your previous encounter, and is probably
a symptom of enabling the prefetcher.  I fixed a bunch of bugs in the
prefetch code recently but maybe this is one I missed.  Can you send
me (off list) the binary you're running and a command line that
reproduces the error?
Thanks,
Steve

Some, like stream and lbm seem to run fine with the prefetcher on as well, so I wonder if this is due to some problem with the coherence protocol, updates to the prefetcher, some problem with memory doing out-of-order accesses or what. Would be nice to figure out what's causing this as the prefetcher really helps increase memory bandwidth.
