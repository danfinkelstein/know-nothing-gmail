Hi everyone,I am trying to run ALPHA_FS with O3 but it is aborting before finishing regardless of the benchmark. COMMAND LINE: build/ALPHA_FS/m5.[any] -d /home/javier/log/mpgenc2_pvt configs/example/fs.py -d --caches -b [benchmark]
ERROR:info: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...panic: Unable to find destination for addr (user set default responder): 0x80c4dbc0
 @ cycle 48692311000[findPort:build/ALPHA_FS/mem/bus.cc, line 334]Memory Usage: 197392 KBytesFor more information see: http://www.m5sim.org/panic/6c40f6ee
Program aborted at cycle 48692311000
AbortedRight now I am just trying to run just 1 thread; 1 CPU. I have been using ALPBench and PARSEC with SimpleCPU and it works fine even with CMP configurations with L2 shared and L2 private cache configurations.
Also, Is SMT still unsupported on FS? I can't seem to get a clear answer form the m5-user digest.I appreciate the help,Javier Texas A&M UniversityComputer Science and Engineering Department
