Ali, thank you very much.
 (1) I modified the src/arch/alpha/linux/process.cc.
       SyscallDesc("ftruncate", unimplementedFunc) =>
SyscallDesc("ftruncate", ftruncateFunc)
     Now, the ftruncate() works.
     I want to implement other system calls.  What the files should I look at?
 (2) The memory system configuration is
       system = System(cpu = [CPUClass(cpu_id=i) for i in xrange(np)],
                physmem = PhysicalMemory(range=AddrRange("2048MB")),
                membus = Bus(), mem_mode = 'timing')
     This is the largest number I can set.
     There are 9 spec2006 benchmarks has the problem
      " terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc' "
     I tried to use a smaller dataset in 410.bwaves. It  finished
correctly without any problem.
     What should I  do to avoid this problem or correct it without
changing the dataset?
Thanks again.
