As example system would be:   4 cores (lets say alpha) private L1 caches, shared L2 DRAM model (RDRAM or SRAM, with power modes control)   I want to build this configuration, and run benchmark tests on this, and tweak the power mode transitioning for the DRAM modules, to see what policy works best in achieving low power.   So, what I want to know is: 1) Can I model such a system?Yes 2) Do DRAM models already exist for M5?Yes, see src/mem/dram.cc although there has been absolutely no validation that the dram model has been is valid after it was integrated with m5 (e.g. we may have messed something up integrating it) 3) Will it be possible to migrate pages from one DRAM rank to another?I have no idea, you should look at the code. 4) Can I get traces if the pages accessed most frequently by tests like splash, or spec2000? You would have to add some code to the dram model to output the page accesses in a format that would be good for this.Ali_______________________________________________
