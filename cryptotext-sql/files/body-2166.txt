I believe the only thing that ever nacks packets is the bus bridge, so
one way to get around this is to increase the number of entries in the
bridge's buffers.  It sort of makes sense that you're running into
problems once you go past 16 cores, as each core should have at most
one uncached access outstanding, and the default buffer size for the
bridge is 16.
