Hi,
I am not sure if I was clear in the last mail.
I am looking at a multi-cpu scenario.
Currently the M5 1.0 has private L1 caches and a shared L2 cache.
I want to make private L2 caches for every cpu and add another shared L3
cache.
I just wanted to make sure that I was on the right track. I am planning to
add the L2, L3 cache defnitions with appropriate bus interfaces in my
python scripts.
However, Im thinking there could be coherance issues that may need to be
resolved if the L2 is now private (for example like mentioned in this post:
http://www.mail-archive.com/m5sim-users@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00223.html).
It would be great if you could point out any other issues I need to take
care of.
Thanks a ton for the help,
