Hi,
I was confused about the following, any help would be appreciated.
If it is the case that there are private L1 and private L2s in M5 1.0, and
if L2 snoops and does an invalidates, how do I send this snoop up to L1?
Does the function slaveAccess(MemReqPtr &req); in bus_bridge.hh do that?
Thank you,
Forum
