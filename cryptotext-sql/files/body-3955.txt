Hi,
I am looking into getting Specweb 2005 to run on M5 with Alpha Full
System.  One of the first steps that I need to do is to build a Java
Virtual Machine to run on M5.  I wonder if anyone has tried compiling
a JVM for Alpha to run on M5?  If so, what JVM do you use?  My current
choices right now are Kaffe and Jikes.  Any other suggestions or tips
on getting these to work would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
