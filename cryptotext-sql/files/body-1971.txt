Hi, Nathan:
  Thank you for your response. I think that I have no ability to
implement the system calls. Therefore, I should try another
alternative. I have also tried to run M5 in full system mode. However,
when I put the executable binaries in the image and mount it in the
simulated system, the programs always suffer "Killed" or "Segmentation
fault". Not only the threaded executables encounters the problem, but
also non-threaded version. In fact, I can not execute any benchmark in
the SpecOMP in ALPHA full system simulation environment.
  My steps are 1) compile the benchmarks of SpecOMP by the
pre-compiled cross-compiler for ALPHA obtained from M5 website. 2)
create a disk image and put the compiled binaries in the image. 3) run
a full system simulation by ALPHA_FS/m5.fast with the disk image
obtained from M5 website. 4) mount the benchmark image in the
simulated system. 5) run the binaries in the simulated system. There
is no error message in both the simulated system and M5 except
"Killed" and "Segmentation fault".
  Does it mean that M5 full system simulation can not support OMP
threaded applications? Or I do something by mistake. How can I obtain
some additional error message besides "Killed" or "Segmentation fault"
to know what is wrong in the simulated system?
Thanks in advance.
