Hello,
 From the posts I've read so far, I know it is difficult to simulate
for a fixed (user defined) number of instructions.
I was wondering though, is it possible to have some counter that
counts the number of instructions, and when a certain number of
instructions is reached, call an "M5 exit" so that the simulator
finishes properly? I hope I'm making sense here.
Also, is MAX_INST a fixed number?
Thanks,
Felix
