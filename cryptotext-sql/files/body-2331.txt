The bus IDs are essentially arbitrary... they're assigned by the bus
as devices are connected to it, which happens in an uncontrolled
fashion as the simulation objects are created.
Note that the each object attached to the bus gets its own ID as well,
so for example if you have split I and D caches then each of those
caches will have its own ID.
