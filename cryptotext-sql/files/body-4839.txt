Hi,
    I met some problems in running multiple benchmarks in full-system.
    To run one benchmark, I can use:
./build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt  ./configs/examples/fs.py â€“b NetperfMaerts
It seems like I don't need to boot up the OS, and just type the command in
local host machine.
    But how to run multiple benchmarks simultaneously? Should I connect to
the simulated console interface and run them ? how to run them?
    Thanks!
Tracy
