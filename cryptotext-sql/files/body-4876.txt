Hi,
I have successfully installed and run m5 2.0 in full
system mode. I can run the benchmarks in full system
and see the stats.
But, I want to run two programs - one single-threaded
and one multithreaded program on m5 in full system
mode. I have installed cross compiler - crosstool-0.42
from the kegel site mentioned in the m5 webpage.
My question is -
How can I compile and run my own programs on m5 and
also how can I specify the threads to be run on
different cores of the processor for the
multi-threaded program?
Eagerly waiting for a reply.
Regards-
Chaitali
