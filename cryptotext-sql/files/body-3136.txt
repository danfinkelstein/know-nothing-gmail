To my knowledge,
you can't run SMT on FS mode but you can run separate cores.
My guess is that you are failing 3 ticks (500 cycles per tick) in AND
probably things just aren't instantiated correctly.
3 ticks sounds like:
Cycle 1: Thread 1: Cache Miss
Cycle 2: Thread 1: Return From Cache Miss
Cycle 3: Thread 2: Fail! (because each stage goes through the
functionality for each thread).
Run the Simulator with some trace-flags to get some details....
I would try "Fetch,Decode,IEW,Commit,Exec,O3CPU".
