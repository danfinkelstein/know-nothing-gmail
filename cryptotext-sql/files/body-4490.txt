We've seen this before... I think it's a bug with certain versions of scons where they save out their options in a format they can't read back in. Â I believe the short-term fix is to go into mnt/scratch/tools/m5/build/options/ALPHA_FS and edit
CPU_MODELS = all
to be
CPU_MODELS = "all"
The more permanent fix is to upgrade to a more recent version of scons.
Please let us know what other problems you're having in detail so we can address them...- Show quoted text -

Hi I'm new to M5 so bear with me...
I've followed the compilation instructions, installed all the relevant
packages and built ALPHA_FS/m5.debug.
I then moved onto the regression tests section, and couldn't manage to run
the example given, indeed the directories you suggest on the compiling
page didn't exist. I have downloaded and unzipped the full system tarball
into /dist/m5/system...
My next thought was that this might be a problem because I built the
.debug binary, so I attempted to rebuild using the .opt binary, but now
whenever I try to run any of the commands you offer in the tutorial I get
the following message:
pundit@m5$ scons build/ALPHA_FS/tests/opt/quick

Thanks in advance for your help,
