Hello,
I'm new at M5 and I'm interested in the simulation of an in-order core.
Since I want to check the behavior of dependent instructions I would
like to simulate a superscalar in-order core.
I figured out that there are 4 "stages" each instruction needs to pass.
Each stage calls the resources of the in-order core.
I tried to modify the "stageWidth"-parameter in the hope that more
buffer slots would be available at each stage but unfortunately nothing
changed. The generated execution-trace is exactly the same.
Thank you very much!
