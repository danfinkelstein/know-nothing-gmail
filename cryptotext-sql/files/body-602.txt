Soumyaroop,No, it's actually more rudimentary than that, but it works.  It's basically a script that takes N checkpoints from single-cpu workloads and aggregates them into another checkpoint with N single-threaded cores so that it looks like a multiprogrammed checkpoint.  So when you do a checkpoint restore, you restore from the aggregated checkpoint.
Being this simple has the added side effect of taking up lots of space, unfortunately, because you need a new checkpoint for every benchmark combination, but it was pretty quick, dirty and simple.  It may be possible to hack more into the inner guts so that M5 knows to read from multiple checkpoints and fix up things like asns and page table entries at runtime, but I havne't done that.  If you are interested, that could be a better solution if you want to run a lot of workloads with a lot of benchmarks in each workload and you're concerned about storage.  
I hope to push the patch in the next few days, it's not that complicated but it's been in my tree and unused a while and I want to make sure the test spin works and have it cleaned up first.  Lisa- Show quoted text -

Thanks for the reply, Lisa.
So, if I understand correctly, the patch that you have enables
simulation of 'n' workloads on 'n' single-threaded cores after
restoring them from 'n' checkpoints, right?
By when do you plan to push the patch to the dev tree? And, I think I
could perform some testing on it. I have some testing infrastructure
set up.
