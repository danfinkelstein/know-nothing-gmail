Support for a second disk in SPARC_FS was never completed. To make that work you would need to modify the mmdisk device model to put both partitions next to each other in memory and generate an appropriate partition map describing the two disk locations. Another option would be to make the disk larger which can also be done. I haven't tried this, but something like it should work:
#
# Mount the existing disk image
#
/usr/sbin/lofiadm -a /export/disk_image_old
/usr/sbin/mount /dev/lofi/1 /mnt
#
# Create the new disk image using a larger size and put
# a filesystem on it
#
/usr/sbin/mkfile -n 1024m /export/disk_image_new
/usr/bin/chmod a+w /export/disk_image_new
/usr/sbin/lofiadm -a /export/disk_image_new
/usr/sbin/newfs /dev/rlofi/2  # make sure you specify the rlofi device
#
# Install a sun4v boot block:
#
/usr/sbin/installboot /mnt1/usr/platform/sun4v/lib/fs/ufs/bootblk /dev/rlofi/2
#
# Clone the filesystem (from /mnt1 to /mnt2)
#
cd /mnt2
/usr/sbin/ufsdump 0f - /mnt1 | /usr/sbin/ufsrestore xf - .
#
# Umount and cleanup the filesystem on the new disk
#
cd /
/usr/sbin/umount /mnt2
/usr/sbin/fsck -y /dev/rlofi/2
/usr/sbin/lofiadm -d /dev/rlofi/2

Hello folks,
Since the free space within the solaris disk image (from opensparc) is not enough for me,
I'm trying to add 2nd disk image storing large benchmark programs.
But the problem is that at the beginning of the simulation it terminates with errors:
# start of error message
panic: Two devices with same range
 @ cycle 0
# end of error message
The error seems pretty obvious but I can't figure it out where in the M5 source code the disk device's address range is assigned to.
I'd really appreciate your help.
Here's what I've done to the makeSparcSystem (FSConfig.py):
    self.disk0 = CowMmDisk()
    self.disk0.childImage(disk('disk.s10hw2'))
    self.disk0.pio = self.iobus.port
###################
# start of lines added
    self.disk1 = CowMmDisk()
    self.disk1.childImage(disk('disk_500mb.img'))
    self.disk1.pio = self.iobus.port
# end of lines added
