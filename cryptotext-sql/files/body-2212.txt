I did some digging and figured out the problem. The issue occurs when
the o3 cpu is miss-speculating and loads from an invalid address. The
request gets to the dcache which issues a readreq for the block on the
membus. The membus matches the default responder (which would return a
response with BadAddress), however the bus also sends the snoops to
the I/O Cache, which in turn forwards it to the i/o bus. The I/O bus
already has a default responder (for PCI config space), so the panic
occurs.
I don't exactly understand why this doesn't occur when an L2 is
present as well and can't really imagine that we always just get lucky.
There are a variety of possible solutions:
a) Don't send accesses to the default responder to the snoopers. If
you're there the address isn't cacheable so no one should be supplying
data.
b) Make the I/O cache filter snoop ranges based on the filter ranges
it already has for range change passing.
c) Have two default options for busses. A default port that is user-
settable, and a port of last resort that always just returns a BadAddr
packet.
d) ?? There are probably a couple more options.
