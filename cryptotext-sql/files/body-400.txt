Hi All,I am trying to implement an error recovery technique for errors occurring in ROB. For injecting the fault, I need to modify bits in one instruction in ROB (like modifying the destination register). As ROB maintains a list of DynInstrPtr, I am trying to replace one of the pointers by another (fault injected) pointer. I can define something likeÂ  
DynInstPtr faulty_instIs it possible to copy the contents pointed to by original inst pointer to the new faulty_inst pointer. Note that I still need to keep the original inst (so other structures will use the original inst)
Best,Syed
