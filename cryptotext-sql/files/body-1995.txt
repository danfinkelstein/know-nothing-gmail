Hi, Lisa.I have tried to run it in this way, I began without sudo and NOT as root, and the initdev.sh asked me if I have a sudo access and I entered the password, and then an error came up!Is there any problem with the MAKEDEV, the error says the MAKEDEV fails to run as root.
I built the image from the scratch because I want to run some programs I wrote myself on M5 in full system mode. I have compiled the alpha-fs mode and when I ran, everything seemed OK as the document says, but it just stalled there and nothing continued. It looked like this:

warn: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...and nothing continues, the simulator just stalls here...I could not find out where the problem is and I have sent a question to the maillist but no one have encountered this.
So I decided to build an image myself, I hope it will work.
I think it was a problem with the initdev.sh script - what if you run
ptxdist images NOT as root or sudo at all?  initdev.sh should ask you if you
have sudo access, and just tell it yet and it will ask for your password
from there.
is there a reason you must build an image from scratch yourself?

Hello Clint, thanks for your answer and for your advice of using the priority as a way to identify the cores, it is a good idea.
I hope you can help me. I have been looking through the code about the policies trying to do what I am looking for, but the code is a little complex. Do you know if FCFS serves the first command that finds in the biu?. The reason to ask this, is that reordering the biu according to my policy is very simple, I am thinking that if I can reorder the biu and if FCFS take the first command, in this way is easy to do what I am trying to do. I just put in the first position of the biu an access of core x, and that's all.
Regarding the statistics, is there any stat related with the hits and the misses?, I am printing the stats, with  mem_print_stat(...) but I do not see any parameter to print the hits and miss in the memory. Do you know any parameter to print that information?. Thank you.
Thanks a lot for your help, it is really appreciable.

Ah, I see what you are saying, but that functionality actually resides within DRAMsim itself. The doTiming method of the DRAMsim M5 object can take as many packets as the network can give it, but it simply finds a free slot in the BIU and places it there for DRAMsim to process on the next memory controller cycle. On line 240, you will see the priority variable which is constantly set to zero. According to the DRAMsim code, that is intended for a purpose such as you are looking for, but I don't believe it does the correct thing right now. If you have the priority field set based on the core number, and then you modify/create a policy to do as you want within DRAMsim, you should be able to get the desired behavior.
The biggest issue you may face is the fact that to actually make the system work, you would have to have requests arrive at (nearly) the same time. If the memory controller is connected to a bus, this is not possible, which would skew the results. If the pressure on the memory system is high enough, then it would be possible to see the selection policy in action, but it is more difficult to guarantee.
Hopefully this information helps.
- Clint

Hello Clint thanks a lot for the patch. I have been testing it and it seems that works fine. Thanks a lot. I have a question regarding the reordering of the accesses. Do the selection policies Greedy, FCFS... work?. What I mean is that when there are several accesses at the *same* time all the accesses are stored inside of the transaction queue in DRAMSim? or on the contrary the accesses are sent one by one to DRAMSim (then DRAMSim process the petition and send the answer, in this case DRAMSim works as FCFS). In this last case then they are stored in the retry list in the bus.cc file. My interest for this is to give some priorities for accesses from some cores, that's why I am asking this, because I want to know who stores the petition, to reorder them there. I hope you knwo what I mean if not please let me know.

Changing the BIU ordering would change the order in which they are
converted into transactions. The policy itself affects the
transactions, so if you were able to reorder the entries in the BIU
before it reached the transaction scheduler, you could make an FCFS
system to whatever you wanted it to. The only issue, is that the
policy applies not only to memory requests, but the commands that each
request is made up of. The get_next_cmd_to_issue does the analog of
get_next_request_from_biu for commands.
By reordering the BIU and using the FCFS policy, what should happen is
that the earlier requests will always have their commands executed
before any other, though commands from multiple requests may still be
executed in parallel when they do not conflict. If you actually
changed the policy to enforce that all commands from an earlier
request would go ahead of all others, then you would reduce the memory
system performance in a very unrealistic way. However, reordering the
BIU entries (as long as you pay attention to read and write ordering
constraints) should not have any adverse effects on overall system
performance.
I'm not sure what you mean by hits and misses, as a centralized main
memory always has 100% hit rate (since it is neither a cache nor a
memory slice).
