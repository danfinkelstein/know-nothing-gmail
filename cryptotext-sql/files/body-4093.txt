Ali,I tried that.  I get a python error:  "AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'stats'".  I'm not entirely sure why and haven't been able to figure it out.  I'm sure there's a fairly straightforward reason, but I haven't been able to figure out m5's python hierarchy enough to sort it out.
I *did* find a workaround, but it's a bit of a hack. Since SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are mapped to signal handlers that dump stats and dump & reset stats, respectively, I can have python send itself a signal which will cause the stats to be dumped on the next cycle:
   os.kill(os.getpid(), signal.SIGUSR1)(I assume the signal handlers are there for FS mode.)  This does seem to work, but as I said, it's not the prettiest thing in the world.  To use this, I have to import os and signal at the top of the file.

Hi Vilas,You should be able to call m5.internal.stats.reset() from withinpython after you do the switch. This will reset *all* stats. If youjust want to reset some the easiest way is probably to wrap the
resetStats() method is swig and then you could call something liketest_sys.cpu.dcache.resetStats() in python after the switchover happens.AliOn Oct 31, 2007, at 12:52 PM, Vilas Sridharan wrote:
