If you're really looking for the source of the request, you should look at the contextID() and threadID() in the Request object.  As Lisa implies, the Packet source field just tells you what device on your bus directly sent you the packet, not what device was the original source of the request.

Running with --trace-flag=Config will tell you which ports correspond with with src numbers...but as for tagging everything with a name during runtime, there isn't anything in place right now for that.  
Also, bear in mind that src values refer to bus port values and are not globally unique, but only unique to the bus they came from.  Lisa

Hello,I am trying to find out in the L2 cache which memory object has sent a request. For example I want to know whether an L1 Data Cache or an L1 Instruction Cache has sent a request to the L2. 
Right now I am working under cache_impl.hh. Is there a way in this file to decrypt pkt->getSrc(), as this number is only a integer. So what I want to do is take pkt->getSrc() and retrieve the actual name of the module of that source.
So lets say L2 gets a packet from source 5, I want to know what the name of that module is! I exhaustively searched the code, the only thing I could think of is using some functions from src/mem/bus.cc & bus.hh, but not sure if thats even possible or correct, that should be a very very last resort. The other method is brute force where I print a Cache trace, and manually decode srcs to the actual module.
My question is, aside from the brute force method, is this possible, or are there easier ways?Thanks!
