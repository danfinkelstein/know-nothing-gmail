Hi thanks for your answer, I've  detected the problem, I just change the /tmp/output directory for a local directory $HOME/tmp/output and it works, I think that M5 should say that he cannot write the file due to permission problems. Well anyway thanks for your answers and sorry for the question that was mainly my fault. Thank you.- Show quoted text -

Statistics are dumped to the file right before m5 exits with a pythonexit handler. What status does m5 exit with (type echo $? <enter>
immediately after m5 ends)?  If you set a break point on'Stats::dump()' does it get reached? What if you don't use -d? Does anm5stats.txt appear in the directory you're running m5 from. Does it
have any statistics in it?Ali
