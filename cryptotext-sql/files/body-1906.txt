The effective addresses are calculated by the memory access instruction objects, either in the execute() method (for the simple atomic CPU) or in initiateAcc() (for the timing CPU models where memory accesses are split into two parts).

Hi all, I am reading the source code of M5, but I can not find where the effective address of a memory access instruction calculated. I thought that the address should be calculated in the IEW stage, so I searched in the iew_impl.hh, lsq_impl.hh and lsq_unit_impl.hh, I only found the executeLoad/executeStore functions, but those functions seem do something else. 
Can anyone tell me where should I find? Where a memory access instuction is actually executed? Thand you!
