I don't have experience with all those benchmarks, but mcf uses more
memory than some of the others and has worse caching behavior. It's
possible you don't have enough memory allocated for your simulations, or
because it allocates more memory it just happens to go beyond what the
host can support and the OS kills m5 or m5 exits. We would likely need
more information to be able to tell you much more than that.

I have tried 3 different machines and m5 dies with the only message printed is Killed or srun: sending ctrl-c to job. Ocassionally m5 ends with code 137. It happens with lucas,swim, mcf and applu. Any idea?
