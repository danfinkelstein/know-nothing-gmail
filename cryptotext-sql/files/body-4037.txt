First, please keep your questions to the list and not to me directly for everyone else's benefit.
Another follow up to my previous mail:
I tried using a static variable (float), doing all calculations with it. Now I want to dump the value of this at the end, so I tried assigning it to oa Formula stat so that it is printed out at the end.
Stats:: Formula energy;
in the regStats,
energy = static_variable;
Problem is this stat is not being printed at all. Any ideas?
If you don't at least give a stat a name (using the .name() function), it won't print.
