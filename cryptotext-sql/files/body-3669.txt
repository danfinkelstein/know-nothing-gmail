hi, i'm actually using beta3. haven't gotten around to shifting to beta 4. by the way, i found the error already. apparently, i did not follow the instructions "to the letter" after all
Since we want to change 'AtomicSimpleCPU' to 'MyCPU' we will just
replace all the names in the atomic.* files and name them mycpu.* files:I did not change text instances of "AtomicSimpleCPU" to "MyCPU" and just proceeded to rename the files. Silly me. It's okay now, I've gotten MyCPU to compile.
Anyway, thank you so much to those who tried to help me. I'd try to help out with the wiki when and if i could.  =)- Show quoted text -On Dec 28, 2007 2:42 AM, Nathan Binkert <

.hh files are.  You also have to add it to the SConscript file with aSimObject() callAlso, the way Korey mentioned adding the new CPU object isn't the same inbeta4.  There is a SConsopts file where the new CPU model options are
added to the build system.Grep for SimpleCPU in all files in the src/cpu/simple directory and you'llsee what I'm talking about.I'm honestly not sure that either issue would manifest itself with your
error message.  If these things are the problem, would you be willing tofix the tutorial on the wiki?  If not, can you tar up your whole directory(except for the build directory, please don't include that), stick it
somewhere and send a URL?  If you don't have a webserver that you can putit on, you can send me the tarball in a private mail.Thanks,   Nate_______________________________________________
