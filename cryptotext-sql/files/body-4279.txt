Elliott,
 
Have you tried running your SPEC2006
binaries on the FS version of M5?  That may solve the problem with the
benchmarks not running.

M5 Users,
  Greetings.  I am a new to both M5 and the list so please forgive me
if I say anything stupid.  I am currently trying to get the SPEC CPU2006
benchmarks to run on M5.  I searched the list archive and found absolutely
no mention of anyone trying to do this, so if this is futile/not supported,
please feel free to ignore the rest of this email.  
  Under Ubuntu 7.04 (64-bit), I managed to build crosstool's (
http://www.kegel.com/crosstool/ ) Alpha gcc/g++/gfortran compilers and
subsequently build Alpha binaries for all the SPEC06 benchmarks. 
Unfortunately, the only benchmark I could get to run correctly was bzip2. 
All the rest either produced a page table fault/core dump or gave me an error
due to an unimplemented syscall (stat64).  
  Is there a trick to getting these benchmarks to work correctly?  Is
this even possible at this point?  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
Elliott
