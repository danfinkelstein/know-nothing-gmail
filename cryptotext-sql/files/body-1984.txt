Hello,
Regarding the question of how to run your own benchmarks in FS, it is
not necessary that you create a new disk image. You can use the one
that is provided in the wiki, in this link you can download one
http://www.m5sim.org/dist/current/m5_system_2.0b3.tar.bz2
What you need to do is add your own programs in the disk image
(linux-latest.img), to see how to do it read this question in the FAQ,
How do I add files to a disk image?. And after to run your program in
FS you need to create the rcS file change the directory for the image
in SysPath.py, and I think thatÂ´s all.
I do not why you say that the SE mode is not suitable for what you
want, you can run any program in SE mode, the thing that I do not
quiet sure know is if you can is run multithread programs in SE, I saw
some patches to do that, but in theory as M5 is provided you cannot.
I hope it helps.
