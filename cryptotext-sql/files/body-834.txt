Hello,
I noticed that the M5 pal code is based on the ev5, is it possible to
make it ev6 or ev67? Or are there no benefits?
My main overall issue I am thinking about is  I am trying to see if
their is any problems in my compiled benchmarks, as I have made them
ev67 code, ev5 has given me lower ipc as well as a few problems in
unimplemented SIMD like instructions. I am not happy about my compiled
PARSEC benchmarks IPC, the main problem is I my simulations keep going
into palmode, stalling my OoO processor, and killing IPC.
Thanks,
EF
