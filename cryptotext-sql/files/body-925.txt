Hello,
From my understanding Ticks are independent of cpu clock cycle, I was
wondering if their an easy way to normalize CurTicks to be expressed
in terms of clock cycle. Are there functions or variables to do that?
Like
normalize(CurTick), or perhaps a parent-clock variable, where I can
make my own functions.
Thanks
EF
