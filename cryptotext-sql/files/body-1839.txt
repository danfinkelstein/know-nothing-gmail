Hi Nate, thank you for your reply, your suggestion is very helpful to me, although something still confused me.The boot process of Gentoo is very slow, your suggestion must be greatly useful to solve this problem. Follow your suggestion. I read the /etc/init.d/bootmisc  and  /etc/inittab to see what the gentoo does in boot time. Your initial script seems only mount the file system, then execute the init.sh by M5.  Could you please give me some hint how this scripte work well ? The boot process seems has a lot of things to do, not just mounting the file system. 
I guess the line execfile init.sh is executed by Gentoo, can it invoke the m5 command ?Sorry for such silly question, but they really confuse me. Thank you !

I also suggest that you don't use gentoo's init scripts, but rather
implement your own init script.  This is so you can know exactly what
applications are running and also minimize boot time.  I've appended
the init script that I use with gentoo that works in a similar way to
our original boot scripts.

#!/bin/sh
echo "mounting filesystems..."
mount -n -o remount,rw /dev/root /
mount -a
echo "execute init script..."
/m5/bin/m5 execfile init.sh
/bin/bash
