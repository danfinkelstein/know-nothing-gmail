First, I sortof agree with Nathan. It did confuse me a lot until this recet exchange of email among Ali,Steve and Nathan. In my case, I introduced two cache ports in every cache. One port is used to send packets on a bus that connects to a bridge port. The bridge port is the only destination so I set the destination of packets as the port id of bridge. The bridge processes the packet and send it to another bus. The other bus also connects to the second port of all caches. This is where the problem breaks in. I thought setting destination to BROADCAST will sent the packets to all the cache ports. As for Ali's question on what address I am using; none. The way I solved the problem was using the m5:hash_map<short,Busport*> data structure to send the packet to every cache connected to bus. This is the behavior I presume should be reserved for BROADCAST flag. I have three questions moving forward:
what does the address used in packets represent anyway? How to register devices as snoop devices? How to get around the dirty fix of printing the port ids and setting deestinations in packets as I often do?
Thanks !
