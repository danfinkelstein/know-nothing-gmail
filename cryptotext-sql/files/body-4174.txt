thanks ali!  i have a follow up question, this time regarding the SPLASH-2 benchmarks. reading that running SPLASH-2 in FS mode is less problematic than running it in SE, I tried running it in FS mode. I downloaded the SPLASH-2 benchmarks from m5sim.org, from a link in the mailing list archives. There are binaries included, but they're not compiled for alpha-linux, so I have to compile* them from the source code. running "make" at the command line while at the source folder yields the following command line output:  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  cc -c  -I../../../../parmacs.upc.3/pthreads code.c code.C: In function ‘main’: code.C:116: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function ‘exit’ code.C: In function ‘Log_base_2’: code.C:227: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function ‘exit’ code.C: In function ‘startrun’:

It's not a question of input  files or anything else, the problem is that binary. I would guess that its a OSF/1 binary and not a Linux binary or it's not a binary at all. Just take some random file of bits, make it executable and run it. You'll get the same error.AliOn Oct 7, 2007, at 6:10 AM, w. tan wrote:actually the entire command line output went like# ./twolf00.peak.ev6 testmodprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No such file or directorymodprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No such file or directorybash: ./twolf00.peak.ev6: cannot execute binary file(sorry for not including the last line in my last email, my bad)so i think the
 benchmark was not executed. and besides, no output file was produced. the name of the executable changed  since i switched to the precompiled binary i downloaded off the Internet(so the crosscompiler can't be the culprit). am i missing something? i mean, what i did basically was place the binary and the input files in the image(latest-linux.img, the one that came with the m5 distro), boot the simulator, and then run the executable.is that the correct procedure  for running  benchmarks in FS mode?thanks a lot for taking time to answer my questions.Ali Saidi <saidi@umich.edu> wrote: That error shouldn't be a problem. The benchmark is almost certainly still running, just some syscall it did attempted to load a module, however that module isn't
 necessary. AliOn Oct 5, 2007, at 9:49 PM, w. tan wrote:i am trying to run cpu2000 benchmarks in full system mode, and already compiled the benchmarks using the crosscompiler. after copying the binaries to the image i then tried running the benchmarks within the simulated system. i got the error # ../TimberWolfSC stdcellmodprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No such file or directorymodprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No such file or directoryafter looking around the net for a while i came upon this message wherein steve advised another user to have the benchmark(it was not exactly the same benchmark though) statically linked to get around this. i then tried statically linking twolf by adding "-static" to the makefile's "gcc" argument and then
 crosscompiling again. the binary's size did increase, but the results are still the same, it still looks for modules.dep. any ideas? thanks a lot.
