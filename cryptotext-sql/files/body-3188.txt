I have run most spec benchmarks using timing mode. However, using detailed model I am getting the following error with almost every benchmark very early in the simulation. Is there any thing wrong with the parameters of my O3CPU. Following is one example for gap. System consist of four cores, private L1, pivate l2 and a shared L3 with Physical memory (not DRAM).
panic: Tried to access unmapped address 0xffffffffffffffe0.
