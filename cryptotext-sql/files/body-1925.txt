Hi all,
Is it possible that I can reconfigure the cache hierarchy during runtime
in M5? For example, say initially I have a three-level cache hierarchy,
i.e., cpu->L1->L2->L3->off-chip memory, after simulating a few cycles, I
want to disable L1 and connect cpu directly to L2. Is that doable?
I tried something like this after simulating 1 million cycles. But it
failed somehow.
test_sys.cpu[0].icache = l1_ic # reconnect cpu to l1 icache
test_sys.cpu[0].dcache = l1_dc # reconnect cpu to l1 dcache
test_sys.cpu[0].icache_port = l1_ic.cpu_side
test_sys.cpu[0].dcache_port = l1_dc.cpu_side
test_sys.cpu[0].icache.mem_side = test_sys.cpu[0].toL2Bus.port[0]
test_sys.cpu[0].dcache.mem_side = test_sys.cpu[0].toL2Bus.port[1]
It looked to me that even after reconnecting the ports, the statistics
for L1 instruction cache and data cache still keep increasing...
Thank you,
--Xi
