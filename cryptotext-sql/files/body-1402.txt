Actually this is a hardware coherence protocol issue and is unrelated to Linux.  You probably need to increase the number of MSHRs in one of your downstream caches.  In general the number of MSHRs in a given cache should be roughly equal to (probably slightly greater than) the sum of the MSHRs of all the caches above it (i.e., closer to the CPU) so that it can handle all possible outstanding accesses.

with linux2.6.27 I have been able to boot 24 cpus. However, beyond that I get the error,"need to implement cache resending nacked packets"...
does the linux scheduler is a limiting factor on number of cpus or M5?
