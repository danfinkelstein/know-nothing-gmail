Thanks, Gabe. My comments are embedded in your reply.On Mon, Jul 13, 2009 at 8:57 PM, Gabriel Michael Black <gblack@eecs.umich.edu> wrote:
There are a few problems with doing things this way. First, there are no guarantees that SMT is supported for SPARC on O3 as far as I know. Someone with more experience with O3 and SMT would have to comment there, but the fact that there are no regressions for it suggests that it's at least untested.
It appears to me that making smt work for sparc should not be a lot of work. Most of the code CPU modeling is ISA independent. If someone could give me some directions, I should be able to get this working pretty quickly. Please correct me if I am wrong though.
 
Second, I don't know if all the binaries that regression needs are going to be available for SPARC. If it just uses the "hello" binary then that might work out.
That is correct. "hello" is the binary that is used. 
Third, if the binary exists and runs correctly, copying the reference outputs from alpha to sparc will almost certainly not be what you want. The many detailed statistics O3 tracks will definitely change when a completely different binary compiled for another architecture is used.
I agree with you completely here. I should correct one of the statements that I made in my last email. I made a copy of the test for the "test.py" script that instantiates the workloads (and not for the gold outputs).

Thanks for your replies.
All I did were the following (from <m5-root-dir>):
1. Made a copy of the test (although this appears to serve only as gold
ouputs):
% cp -r tests/quick/01.hello-2T-smt/ref/alpha
tests/quick/01.hello-2T-smt/ref/sparc
2. Ran the testcase:
% scons build/SPARC_SE/tests/fast/quick/01.hello-2T-smt
What steps should I take to debug this further?
regards,
Soumyaroop.

It's also a sign of a deadlock... perhaps there's a deadlock situation
that's not covered by the assertion.
