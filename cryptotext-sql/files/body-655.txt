Thanks Ehsan,  It would be nice, however, to have a solution that doesn't require downloading the crosscompiler... is this information available somewhere else?  Perhaps it would make sense to add to the M5 site?

Hi,  On UTCS systems, we have always had trouble using the precompiled crosscompilers on the M5 site, as we have run into issues with directory structure or host system architecture.  However, we have been able to build our own crosscompilers using crosstool to get by.  We noticed that the M5 site has gcc-4.3.2 available in the downloads section, but we were hoping to get more information about the build, so that we can replicate it.  Can someone let us know which versions of glibc, binutils, linux headers and patches were used to build each of the crosscompilers?
