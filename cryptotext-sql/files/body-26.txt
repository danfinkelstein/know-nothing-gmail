That explains why the AtomicCPU is doing it correctly.
Thanks!

Just to clarify, "deadlock" in this case doesn't necessarily mean that
the application you're simulating deadlocks.  More likely (especially
in this case) it's a deadlock in the simulator itself, e.g., some
corner case where the CPU is waiting for something and due to a bug
the event that's supposed to wake it up doesn't get scheduled or gets
ignored or something like that.

What is the expected number of instructions for your simulation?
What is the number in the stats file after it exits?
The answers to those questions will help you find where the deadlock point
potentially is.
Also, if you turn the progress intervals on you can see where the deadlock
potentially is at well because you start seeing intervals of 0 instructions.

Hi all,
After executing a subset of MiBench I received this exit cause for a few
benchmarks:
Exiting @ cycle 9223372036854775807 because simulate() limit reached
CRC32 and gsm encode with the large input set are the two benchmarks that
cause this message.
On the mailing list I read that this happens due to deadlocking for
example.
However, I run this code on a single InOrderCPU and I don't see where CRC
could possibly deadlock. Besides, it executes correctly on the Atomic CPU.
Does anybody have ideas about possible causes? Or did anybody ran
CRC32/gsm encode large on the InOrderCPU to completeness?
Regards,
Max
