>Hello,
>        I am new to M5 and I am trying to familiarize myself with the simulator. I ahve installed the full system version and I have a few questions. Well, what i had in mind was very basic. I wanted to run 2 simple programs together and i wanted to specify the number of processors, say, as 3 and then assign the workload for each processor myself. say, cpu 1 and 2 ran just program 1 and cpu 2 ran program 2. So I wanted control over the scheduling instead of the linux scheduler, as it is the case currently. I looked at the mailing lists but I did not get a clear picture of what is required. Thank You for any suggestions,
