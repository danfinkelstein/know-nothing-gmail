You need to either compile it on an Tru64/Alpha or Linux/Alpha or use a cross compiler. For instructions on building a cross compiler look at this page: http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Using_linux-dist_to_Create_Disk_Images_and_Kernels_for_M5

Hi,
I am trying to run some program (c code) on the FS simulator.
Does the simulator provide any compiler so that I can compile
the program in the simulation system? Â If no, can I just
compile the program in some linux system and run it on the
simulator? Thanks a lot.
Xin
