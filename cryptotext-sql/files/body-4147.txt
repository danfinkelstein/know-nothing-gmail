Hi all,
 
I have some questions about the tagged prefetcher. If I configure tagged prefetcher in my simulation system, will it increase the amount of memory accesses? If that is true, could I use a queue in PhysicalMemory to buffer lots of packets without sending a packet back immediately after it arrives? I have tried to buffer many packets after a long time execution, but the number of the buffered packets in queue is at most 4. Is that caused by the strong data dependency of benchmarks or the simulation mechanism of M5? By the way, I have tried many benchmarks and all the results are the same. I wonder if I could change the configuration file or some simulation mechanism to implement buffering lots of packets in PhysicalMemory. 
 
Another question is about the configuring to use prefetcher. I use configs/example/se.py as my configuration file and I just modify the L1 cache model as follows:
 
if options.caches:
system.cpu[i].addPrivateSplitL1Caches(
L1Cache(size’32kB',prefetch_policy='tagged',prefetch_miss='true'), L1Cache(size = '64kB',prefetch_policy='tagged',prefetch_miss='true')) 
 
Unfortunately, I get such information when I run M5 simulator:
   ………..     
 0: system.physmem: Write of size 8 on address 0x3802018 data 0x0
warn: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...

I have not modified source of M5, why does it get a segmentation faults? Is there anything wrong with my configuration file?  Is the TAGGED prefetcher the only implemented prefetcher? Because when I use GHB and STRIDE and recompiled the source, I get lots of errors.
 
Could anybody help me?
 
Thank you very much in advance!
