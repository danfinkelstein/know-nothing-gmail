Apart from segemntation fault, another problem is as soon as one of the processes finishes, the simulation comes to a hault. Is it how the simulator is supposed to be?
That's the design, yes.  Typically if you're trying to gather
statistics on a four-thread workload you don't want those polluted by
phases where only three (or fewer) threads are running.  If you really
want to let all 4 threads finish you can change this behavior by
playing with the emulated exit() syscall (see exitFunc()) and the
corresponding SimLoopExitEvent() (maybe use a CountedExitEvent()
instead).

Because, in the final statistics I only see the results for one of the four processors which sounds as if only one of them was running thr process.
If you're seeing this, then that means that radix isn't actually using
all 4 cpus like you think it is; maybe it didn't parse the
command-line args correctly, or it encountered a different error
before it got to the thread-forking step.
