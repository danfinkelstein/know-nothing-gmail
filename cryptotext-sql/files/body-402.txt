Hello,
I want to modify the pipeline depth next to the latencies of the
functional units.
The extra stages that I want to add shouldn't do anything since I'm only
interested in the change in CPI they cause.
Did anybody do this before?
I tried it by modifying cpu/inorder/pipeline_traits.cc and
cpu/inorder/pipeline_traits.hh (see below).
The result of my execution is correct but however it takes 20 times as
much time!!!
I debugged the code a little bit and found that there is some problem in
the instruction fetch:
In cpu/inorder/resources/cache_unit.cc addrList accumulates a lot of
instructions because CacheUnit::setAddrDependency is called more than
CacheUnit::removeAddrDependency.
This happens only for the calls to the instruction cache (and thus
originating from the 0th stage (instruction fetch))!
Before modifying the code this did not happen.
Does anyone has an idea to fix this problem?
Thanks!
Max
