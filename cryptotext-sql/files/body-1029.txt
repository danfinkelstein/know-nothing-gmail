I see that the wiki neglects to mention that you need to connect to
the console of th simulated machine using telnet or (preferably)
m5term, something like:
% telnet localhost 3456
or
% m5term localhost 3456
where 3456 is the port number m5 prints out after "Listening for
system connection".
See also http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/M5term.
