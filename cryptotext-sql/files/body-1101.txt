Hi Steve:
    Thank you for your reply. The problem for my code to be outside of
the m5/src tree is that there are code in src/cpu/cpu_model.py that
has to
#include "cpu/timingtracecpu/timing_trace.hh"
    If I put my code outside the m5/src/ how do I make sure the
cpu_model.py can still include the header file? Thank you again for
your comment.
Regards
James Wang
