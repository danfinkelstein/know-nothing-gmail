Yes, though the model for the hard disk isn't particularly
sophisticated.  If you need very accurate timing, you'll have to add
some effort.  Also, it depends on how you plan to use flash.  If you
plan to use it as a disk device, then you can just tweak the disk
model, but if you want to use it in a more tightly integrated fashion,
you may have to add some effort, though this probably is not all that
difficult either since you could probably just tweak the main memory
model in some way.
