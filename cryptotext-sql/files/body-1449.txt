I disagree on if you *could* but agree on why it's infeasible to
construct such a solution.
IMO, There's no reason that you couldnt replace virtual functions,
templates, or defines (VFDs) with an ISA object in whatever specific
cases that are needed. In essence the CPU models are already
independent save for a few spots where you have VFDs to go to
something that needs an ISA specific implementation. So I don't see
why you couldn't hack away and force that to work.
But I totally agree why you wouldn't embark on such a herculean task
and primarily because of the costs involved with getting that to work
(time) and using it when it works (performance).
