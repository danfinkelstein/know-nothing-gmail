Hello, I am very new to the simulator, and I have some questions about simulations in FS mode. In my simulations what I do is boot linux with the atomic CPU take a checkpoint when the booting is over and after switch to the detailed CPU. I copied the commands from the mailing list, and I´d like that someone can confirm me if I am doing the right thing.To take the checkpoint and boot Linux./build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt -d  ./tmp/output  configs/example/fs.py -b Bench --checkpoint-dir=./checkpoint/   To restore from the checkpoint and switching to detailed CPU ./build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt -d  ./tmp/output  configs/example/fs.py -b Bench --caches --l2cache -s -w 200000000000 -r 1 --checkpoint-dir=./checkpoint/After the second one I get many warnings with messsage like this:"warn: Not unserializing 'system.switch_cpus_10.fuPool.FUList3.opList2': no section found in checkpoint.", is this normal?.And finally I do not understand what is the cache warm up, Can anyone please clarify this?.Thanks in advance.Charlas más divertidas con el nuevo  Windows Live Messenger
