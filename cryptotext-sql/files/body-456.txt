The directory is in ALPHA_FS/python/m5/objects, though the
only thing in there is __init__.py.  The rest of the contents of the
directory are gathered from throughout the M5 source tree.  Anything with
a SimObject() call in a SConscript will end up in the objects directory.

Hi Nate,
I am looking post build process directory, but I am not able to find it.
I have compiled m5.debug an ALPHA_FS target.
there is no /src/python/m5/objects directory in the source tree.
I was able to run ALPHA_FS in Full system mode too.
Thanks ,
