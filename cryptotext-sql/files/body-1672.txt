Hi Veydan,
I am not an expert, but I think we are going to have to know what the output
of M5 was to help you with the compiler alpha-linux kernel (first boot
that failed)
as I don't see anything wrong unless an address is out of place. My
guess is
that something interestinghappened on the simulator.
On the second output, I noticed that udev is complaining about an old
version of
the kernel. A quick man shows that is it is a "Linux configurable
dynamic device naming
support". This could be related to the inability to find the hard disk
device with name /dev/hda1
but this is just a guess. I have only tried to boot linux on m5 with
vanilla-kernel 2.6.18. I
say you try that.
Good luck,
-Rick
