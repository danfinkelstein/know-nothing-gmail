Hi,
I have compiled a cross compiler(gcc3.4.3-glibc2.3.5),but got
stuck in compiling linux 2.6.13 kernel. I have download
linux-2.6.13.tar.gz from kernel.org. Unpack it and in the
linux-2.6.13 directory, type the following:
make config ARCH=alpha CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/crosstool/gcc-3.4.3-
glibc-2.3.5/.../alpha-unknown-linux-gnu-
After configuration, type the following to compile the kernel:
make ARCH=alpha CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/crosstool/gcc-3.4.3-
glibc-2.3.5/.../alpha-unknown-linux-gnu-
But I got the error below:
local symbol 0: discarded in section '.exit.text'....
I've never seen that error before.
Could you tell me how you compiled(linux2.6.13?) and got the sample vmlinux?
Pretty much exactly the way you described compiling it above.
Another question: Is it necessary to compile linux kernel for
anyone using the m5 simulator? I mean, can I just build my own
disk image(contains my benchmark) and make it work with
Yes, you can make your own disk image and just the vmlinux you got from the website.
