Hey all,
 
I'm adding my own benchmarks which spawns multiple threads each 
printing out a string. 
 
Things are fine at beginning but when I scale the number of 
threads to 100, a panic takes place:
 
"Memory value only partially satisfies the functional request. Now 
what?"
 
This panic takes place in Packet::checkFunctional(Addr addr, int size, 
uint8_t* data) (mem/packet.cc). A backtrace with gdb reveals 
that it is triggered by the writeFunc( ) system call (sim/syscall_emul.cc), 
which is trying to use CopyIn to emulate printing to the 
screen. The CopyIn sends a functional read request which in turn caused the 
panic. 
 
I appreciate your help.
 
Thanks!
 
Jiayuan
 
p.s. patch is available, just let me know how to send it to you.
