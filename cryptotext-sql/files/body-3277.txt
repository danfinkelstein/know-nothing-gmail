Dumping the statistics to a file is one of the last things m5 does, so if M5 terminated abnormally you wouldn't seen any statistics. Do you have an exact error message? Â I don't know of any case where we end with an error code other than 0,1, or 3 so 03000 seems a bit strange.

Often times (for some workloads and configurations), my simulations end with message Aborted but the benchmarks seems to be working. No statistics are collected though. Under gdb it says program ended with code 03000.
