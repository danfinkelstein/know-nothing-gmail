My AlphaStation 400 EV45 developed a hardware problem and I would like
to boot its Tru64 5.1b OS with M5 so I can recover files.  All of the
disks use AdvFS, including the boot disk.  I plan to connect the SCSI
drives to my PC which has M5's ALPHA_SE built under RedHat Linux.  My
Tru64 licenses are current.
What steps do I need to perform to boot Tru64?
