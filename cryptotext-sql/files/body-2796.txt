Depends on how you want to access it.  If you're just routing certain
addresses to it, then all you need to do is attach it to a bus
somewhere that the CPU can get at it, and make sure its address range
doesn't overlap with the regular dram object.
The trickier part is getting your application to use the new
addresses.  You'd have to do something to the SE-mode page table code
to make sure that the virtual addresses in the application that should
correspond to your sram get mapped to the physical addresses where
your sram is.  The details of that would depend on how exactly your
application tells the system that it wants sram instead of dram (or
however that distinction is made).
