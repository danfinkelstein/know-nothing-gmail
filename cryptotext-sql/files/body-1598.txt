Thanks a lot Clint. I applied your patch but I am getting some errors when I build the simulator. These are the errors that I am getting. Any idea of why I am getting these errors?Thanks,-Raidbuild/ALPHA_SE/mem/dramsim.hh: In constructor ‘DRAMsim::Control::Control(DRAMsim&)’:

The patch was posted to the m5-users mailing list in late January (see [PATCH] Beta patch for M5 2.0 DRAMsim implementation). I don't think it has support for loading the power information file yet, but it would not be difficult to add.

It will be appreciable if you guys can tell me where to get the required patch for this. Also any information about the accuracy of DRAMsim compare to the built in m5 DRAM model?
