Hi all,
I've having trouble running M5 after building it without any
problems using
$scons build/SPARC_FS/m5.debug
then running the regression tests fails
$scons build/SPARC_FS/tests/debug
...
scons: ***
[build/SPARC_FS/tests/debug/long/80.solaris-boot/sparc/solaris/
t1000-simple-atomic/stdout]
Error 1
scons: building terminated because of errors.
with the above error stream file
Warning: rounding error > tolerance
   0.002000 rounded to 0

same happens when running
$build/SPARC_FS/m5.debug -d /tmp/output configs/example/fs.py
...

I guess I'm missing the bin files, "reset_new.bin" and may be
others. currently I only have (console, ts_osfpal, vmlinux)
I couldn't find those files, where can I get them?
or does the following bug means that SPARC is currently not supported?

TIA
