Hi,
I see that the BaseCache.py has parameters split and split_size to indicate
whether the cache is split (is that correct interpretation?)
however I did not find any declaration of L1 cache that sets split=true (Im
assuming that L1 is a split cache for multi processors -- is that right?)
Is it because there is no case of multicore processor in the given examples?
Does it also mean that to split a BaseCache, I just set the split=true and
set the bus interfaces accordingly and all coherence/other issues are taken
care of?
Thanks,
