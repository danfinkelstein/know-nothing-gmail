Dear All,
I wrote a component which has two otherPort references. I have a logic to select
which port to use. For example, in general when recvAtomic(PacketPtr pkt) is
called what we did is
return otherPort->sendAtomic(pkt);
but in my case what I did is
if (logic success)
    return otherPort_1->sendAtomic(pkt);
else
    return otherPort_2->sendAtomic(pkt);
but for the function recvStatusChange(Port::Status status) I can't implement my
logic because it only send me the status which is always 0. To make the system
work I add following lines to this method.
        otherPort_1->sendStatusChange(status);
        otherPort_2->sendStatusChange(status);
this works correctly (What I mean by correctly is, it gives me the same output
as with the normal configuration). But when I check the statistics there is a
huge difference between the normal configuration statistics and this
configuration. I think the wrong implementation of the recvStatusChange(Status
status) may causing this problem.
for me to use my logic, I need a pointer to PacketPtr. Any explanation regarding
above function would be greatly appreciated. I read the comment in the Port
class, but I couldnot get the idea.
thanks and regards,
Isuru
