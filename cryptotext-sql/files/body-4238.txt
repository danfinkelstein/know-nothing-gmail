Additional questions though, 1. does it really take a long time for a benchmark ( i.e. gzip) to run? It's been running for 1 hr now.The time depends on what input set you're using. The reference input would probably take many hours to run to completion. The smred input set can complete a couple of hours.2. what is the purpose of specifying the output file (input.source.out) in M5? if it's okay can you please point me to a URL detailing the rudimentaries of running benchmarks? the spec2000 documentation is a little bit biased on explaining things when running Spec2000 in an operating system(i'm not surprised).http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Running_M5http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Simulation_Scripts_ExplainedThose URLs are all we have on m5sim.org at the moment, perhaps they'll be of some use. If you feel motivated, feel free to create a new page that documents the problems and solutions you've been having.3.in the gzip_source class in cpu2000.py, what's the difference between {ref,smred,mdred,lgred} when you just assigned self.args with the same value in all 4 choices?They are various input sets ref is the reference from spec, the others are of various sizes I think all from the minniespec set. The selection of the different directories in cpu2000.py selects the different sets since they all have the same input file names.4. what are the differences between the 'ref','test','train' directories in the input directory of each benchmark?(how will i know which one to use)The ref/test/train directories are different input sets. Generally that distinction is only useful to compiler people who for example want to profile the code with one set of inputs and then run it with another set.Â Ali_______________________________________________
