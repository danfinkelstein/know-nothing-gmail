Hi Steve,
Interestingly in the process of doing some unrealted research we found
that LRU replacement w/o checking for invalidated block was making a
fairly substantial difference in some single threaded benchmarks
(Sheng is a student I co-advise).  We've been running SPEC 2006 on a
single processor (system emulation mode) w/ a 8MB L2, and there are a
handful of benchmarks where the miss rate is 10-15% higher than
choosing invalidated blocks over LRU.  I assume that the total memory
footprint relative the cache size must mean that the cache isn't
getting fully warmed up but we haven't fully debugged it yet (not sure
what this says about SPEC 2006...).
Assuming our results aren't due to some other bugs this probably
should be incorporated in the default cache replacement policy as most
real systems would select invalid blocks before LRU (especially in the
presence of coherence invalidations).  If you want we can feed back a
patch for the cache replace policy code once we are satisfied there
aren't any other bugs floating in our code.
