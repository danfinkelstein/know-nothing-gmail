Hi Steve,  Thanks for the quick response.  I tried the m5 repository and ran into the same issue.  I have attached the updated src/mem/bus.cc that we had in our old source.  The changes that cause the problem are in calcPacketTiming, updating tickNextIdle and the packet firstWordTime and finishTime.
  Thanks,  Joel- Show quoted text -On Fri, Nov 27, 2009 at 4:14 PM, Steve Reinhardt <stever@gmail.com> wrote:
This bug may or may not be related to your changes; there were a
number of prefetcher bugs that I worked through a while ago and I'm
not sure if they're in m5-stable or not..  In general, m5-stable is
pretty stale and we haven't been very good about pushing bug fixes
there, so if you're trying to bring your code up to date it's much
better to go with the main m5 repository than m5-stable.  If you still
have trouble at that point, let us know.
