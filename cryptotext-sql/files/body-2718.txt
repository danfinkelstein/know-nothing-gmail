The version of /usr/lib/stdc++.so.6 that is on the disk image is older
than the version that you're using to compile the facesim binary. You
could either compile facesim statically, or copy all the libc/libstdc+
+ libraries from the compiler you're using onto the disk image (you'll
probably need to create a bigger one to do this).
