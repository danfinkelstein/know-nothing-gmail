I will document my progress here, perhaps experts here can add their advice and thoughts.I went ahead and recompiled using this website as a guide:http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/perf.html
(I am using the precompiled alpha cross compiler on the m5 website)I tried the flags: -mcpu=EV5 (didnt work)-mcpu=21164 (m5 gave illegal instruction error)-mno-max (disables max instr set, gave a segmentation fault of the benchmark, not in m5)
The flag that worked worked: -mcpu=21064 (a variant of EV4 without extra instruction sets ) Progress so far:The problem is fixed, but ferret has yet to finish compiling, hopefully no more problems.

If you do implement the instruction a quick google search turns up the
following:

which seems to be a testsuite that would validate your implementation.
