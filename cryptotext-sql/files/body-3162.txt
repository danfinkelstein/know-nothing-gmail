As far as I know, SPLASH benchmarks should work fine with SMT.  (Someone speak up if they know otherwise.)  You'd have to modify the  configs/splash2/run.py script to deal with that though.I haven't done this before, so I can't provide any general directions, but if you have more specific questions we can try and answer those.

Hi,As
a part of my course project, my group is trying to study the SMT/CMP
hybrid architectures and study their performance. As a part of the
project we need to vary the parameters like number of cores and number
of threads supported for each core and run simulations. As per my
understanding, such configurations can be defined using M5, but I am
confused as to how to run the simulations and what benchmarks to use. I
am new to the M5 simulator and I trying to figure out the best way to
work on my project.
The spec cpu benchmarks have lincense issues and currently I donot have
access to them. So I wanted to try the SPLASH benchmark suite. Can some
one help me understand how I can run these simulations using SPLASH
benchmarks (if it is possible). It looks like the current binaries for
splash benchmarks on the M5 website work only in ALPHA SE mode and they
donot work with SMT cores. If I try to work in ALPHA FS mode, will I be
able to simulate SMT/CMP architecture workloads. 
If some one has already done these kind of simulations, your
suggestions would be very useful. I am trying to run the simulations on
MacOs Leopard, will I be able to use linux-dist to build my libraries
properly.Thank you,
Sahithi
