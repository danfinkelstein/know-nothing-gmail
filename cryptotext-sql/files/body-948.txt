Soumyaroop,Please check out a recent patch I posted to m5-dev update the instruction counts. All the regression tests need to be run, verified, etc. before pushing that patch into the tree.There is also a conversation on m5-dev titled "Stats Changes" where we discussed the consistency in stats naming across CPU models. 
The most recent relevant post to you was Aug. 28th where I remarked that the O3 is not counting "nops" and "prefetches" which is throwing off the instruction counts in comparison stats.For the O3, the higher instruction count counts nops and prefetches while the lower count doesnt. The patch I'm providing aligns toward the higher instruction counts.- Show quoted text -

Korey, weren't you looking at this?  I think the lower number may not
be counting no-ops or something like that.
