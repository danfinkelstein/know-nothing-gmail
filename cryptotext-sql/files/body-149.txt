Hello,
I was wondering what is the exact status of the ISA development for
X86? Are there specific instructions that have not been implemented?
If so, which ones?
Furthermore, I noticed that the se.py file is not configured to handle
scripts (.rcS) as the fs.py script is. Aside from a few python script
modifications, is that all that would be required to support script
file simulation for SE (not to mention X86_SE and possibly sparc isa),
i notice that it currently only supports alpha.
In the long run, i am interested in running the parsec benchmarks on
the X86 ISA, (SE simulation is fine) and would like to know if the
current stable version requires relatively modest
modifications/improvements for my studies, and if not, if the current
dev-repo is a viable alternative.
Thanks.
Malek
