Hi,I was looking in the archieve on how to use the cpu2000.py file for spec2000benchmarks. Though I found some help from the archieve, I was not able toget results using what was mentioned. I had created the same file structure
that was mentioned in the archieves.Unable to find workload for gzip. This is what that I can see in the .e filewhen i run it..Thanks,
