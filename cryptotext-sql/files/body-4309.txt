Hi there,    I run those two CPU models on the same application which uses 4 threads to do summation. The total cycles of TimingSimpleCPU  is 1449144666000 while that of AtomicSimpleCPU is only 65388275500.Why there are so many difference in the metric and which one I should adopt it?
    Thank you very much and best wishes.                                                                                            Yue                                                                                            09-10-2007
