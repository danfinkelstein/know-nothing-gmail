Thanks Steve ! I figured that out with the traces.
However just tell me, i dont see any writebacks to physical memory if data is updated in L2 in the traces when i use flags="Bus cache" on command line? I am simulating a uniprocessor with L1 and L2.
If there are write backs to physical memory and there is a multiprocesor system, are they broadcasted over system bus like the read requests?
