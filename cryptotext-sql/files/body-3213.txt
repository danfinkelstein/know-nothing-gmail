We use mcf as a regression test so it at least works a little. If it only runs a few thousand instructions, it's likely either the standard library initialization is failing, or mcf itself is quiting with an error very early in execution. If you haven't yet, you should check it's output and see if there are any messages. Also, with so few instructions, it should be fairly easy to add --trace-flags=Exec --trace-file=trace.out to your command line and inspect what it's doing directly. The function it's executing last should be a good clue as to what's going on.

Did anybody tried running mcf benchmark in SE mode. All of the other SPEC CINT benchmarks I am using run for millions of instructions but mcf runs for a couple of thousand even under ref input. _______________________________________________
