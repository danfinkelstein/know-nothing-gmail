Hi thanks for all your answers:
I have been able to simulate some test in the ALPHA_SE mode, but I don;t know how I can get the performance results, time of execution, speed..., when I run the simulation I said that I want the output in /tmp/output but in the file that is written m5stats.txt, there is nothing. How can I get those results?, thanks.- Show quoted text -

"cores" is marketing terminology for CPUs that happen to be on thesame chip. The only architectural difference (relevant to simulation)from CPUs on separate dies is relative speed of communication (e.g. a
shared L2 bus can run at an on-chip speed).--Philip Machanick (Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland)39 Cunningham Street, Taringa, Qld 4068, Australiahttp://opinion-nation.blogspot.com/
