Hi thanks for the help,1) I ran 3 days ago:hg clone http://repo.m5sim.org/m5
2) used this command line = build/ARM_SE/m5.debug                 gcc version = 4.2.4 3) Got the following errors:Building in /home/javier/m5/build/ARM_SEUsing saved variables file /home/javier/m5/build/variables/ARM_SE

Another doubt that I have is should ARM work with O3/SMT CPU?Thanks,Javier MalaveTexas A&M UniversityComputer Science and Engineering Department

Hi everybody,
I have notices that there has been some modification to the ARM architecture
on m5 repository.
I downloaded a few weeks ago the m5 with Mercurial and the ARM_SE does not
compile. (I had been working with ALPHA but, research wise I need ARM)
I downloaded again from the repository and it still does not compile; this
time with different errors.
Should it compile or is it not stable? Is there a stable version of ARM on
m5 at the moment?
Thanks,

You shouldn't send any email to both m5-dev and m5-users. Almost
everyone that reads m5-dev also reads m5-users. What compile errors
are you getting and with what version of gcc? ARM_SE was just
integrated into our repository a little while ago and may not work,
but it should at least compile.

Are you using the arm extras stuff from stephen hine's website, or are
you using the stuff that has been integrated into the development
tree?  (We only integrated it about a week or so ago)

Hi all, I am confused about how the build/ALPHA_FS/arch/alpha/decoder.cc
generated, it says in its header that the src/arch/alpha/isa/main.isa
generate it.  Now I want to add some attributes to some instructions such as
Jsr.  In the decoder.cc:4061 there is a define for Jsr and assigne some
attribute in the flas. If I want to add an extra one like
  flags[isJsr] = true;
How can I modify the main.isa to let it generate what I want ? Thanks !
