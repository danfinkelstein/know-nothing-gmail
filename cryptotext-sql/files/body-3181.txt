The Alpha ISA has a couple of reserved instructions. with opcodes ranging from 01 to 0E. The support for these is also present in m5, as seen in src/arch/alpha/isa/decoder.isa, lines 798 and onwards. We have added an instruction and required program logic to use two of these reserved opcodes as two new instructions. 
The problem we are facing in using these is that the inline gcc assembler doesn't recognize them. i.e:__asm__ ("OPC01");in a C program doesn't get assembled. 
Does anyone know what is a good solution in this case? I imagine this could be a common problem with m5 users, as they might want to add some logic to the processor which gets triggered by an assembly instruction.
Thanks in advance for any helpReza
