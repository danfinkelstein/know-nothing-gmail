Hello, I am trying to stop my workload in FS but I am having problems
I am using this instruction in the fs.py file:
test_sys.cpu[i].max_insts_all_threads = 50000000
Basically what it happens is that the simulation starts and finish
immediately without running any instructions. In SE mode those
instructions work fine, are those commands suppose to work in FS?.
And another question is there any way to make that all the CPUs
execute the same number of instructions?. The reason for that is that
I am comparing different algorithms in the cache, and when I run for
example algorithm A, the CPU 3 execute 4e6 instructions and when I run
algorithm B the CPU 3 execute 4.5e6. So what I want is that both of
them do the same number of instructions and in that way the tests are
equal.
Thanks a lot in advance.
