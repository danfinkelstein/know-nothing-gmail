Honestly,
it might be time to just comment out or delete that assertion.
As I recall, that was used when testing the O3CPU for correctness and
to make sure we didnt run out of memory allocating instructions and
never deleting them.
But now it might be more of a hindrance as people simulate with more
CPUs. Doing it perCPU would be nice, but then what happens in x86 code
when you have more microOps (?) or if someone adds some type of new
extension to the front end of the CPU?
I say just go ahead and comment that line out or maybe put a DEBUG,
DPRINTF warning there ...  ...
But I could be wrong...
