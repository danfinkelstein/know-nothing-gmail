M5 in SE mode doesn't support several of the system calls required for
implementing multithreading.  To solve the problem, you need to
implement the system calls required by OpenMP.  Also, depending on how
you want things to work, you might have to write a thread scheduler
for SE mode to load balance the CPUs.  If you do any of this, please
share your patches.
Another alternative is to run M5 in Full System mode.  If you do this,
you'll be running the linux kernel and get all of the system calls it
supplies.
