Hi Ali,
I know that my implementation of mremap() is not correct. I let
remap() map to the previous block and only change the block size. It
is just a quick implementation for the SPEC2006 programs. For example,
450.soplex and 454.calculix need this function, and this simple
implementation can let these two benchmarks finish correctly. I was
planing to correct the  mremap() in the past, but I began to work on
other stuffs. I will find a time to clean this implementation and make
it right.
Thanks,
Meng-Ju
