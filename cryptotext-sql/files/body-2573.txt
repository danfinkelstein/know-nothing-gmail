"Internal compiler error" is always indication of a bug in the
compiler.  I'd definitely try a different version of g++.  I just
successfully compile m5.prof with gcc 4.2.3.  It will also work in
4.3.2 when the new stable version is released, hopefully in a week or
so.  (I'm still testing patches that make 4.3 work).
