Thank you ! Steve. I have found the line this->fault = this->staticInst->initiateAcc(this, this->traceData);in the executeLoad/executeStore function of lsq_unit_impl.h.I guess there must be something I still not understand yet, because I could not find the initiateAcc of StaticInst object.
The "memory access instruction object" in your letter is unclear for me. Is it in the arch/alpha/isa/mem.isa. How can I find the initiateAcc() of an o3 cpu model? That's really what I need to modify now.
I search the initiateAcc under the source directory using   grep initiateAcc * -r, what I got seemed of no use. The only thing that I found maybe useful is this:initiateAccTemplate = eval(exec_template_base + 'InitiateAcc')
But I do not quite understand that.  Could you please tell me where can I find the execution body of initiateAcc?  Thand you !

The effective addresses are calculated by the memory access instruction
objects, either in the execute() method (for the simple atomic CPU) or in
initiateAcc() (for the timing CPU models where memory accesses are split
into two parts).
