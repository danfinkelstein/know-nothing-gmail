You may treat the EtherSwitch as a general EtherLink.
The EtherSwitch has N Interfaces and N*(N-1) Links,
when N=2, it has 2 Interfaces and 2 Links, which is the
same model as EtherLink. (EtherSwitch also has inner class
Interface and Link, as shown in my previous email)
I have tested my EtherSwitch model in M5 in the case N=2,
it works well.
