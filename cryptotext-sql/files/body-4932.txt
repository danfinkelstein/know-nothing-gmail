The split parameters for BaseCache have to do with some experimental cache partitioning code that I don't think we released. Â They're not related to the idea of split I/D caches.

Hi,
I see that the BaseCache.py has parameters split and split_size to indicate
whether the cache is split (is that correct interpretation?)
however I did not find any declaration of L1 cache that sets split=true (Im
assuming that L1 is a split cache for multi processors -- is that right?)
Is it because there is no case of multicore processor in the given examples?
Does it also mean that to split a BaseCache, I just set the split=true and
set the bus interfaces accordingly and all coherence/other issues are taken
care of?
Thanks,

Hi,
is there a command like cpu.addPrivateSplitL1Caches in m5 1.0 that I can
use?
I am trying to add a shared L3 and split the L2 just like the exisiting
L1.
so I was wondering if there is some python command that does that.
Thanks you
