The ASPLOS tutorial has a section on defining a new SimObject.   Once
you do that you'd just need to take all the wattch globals and make
them fields in the C++ object, and put the wattch code in an object
method.  You could then define parameters for that SimObject to pass
in all the pointers and stuff you need from the python (number of
cpus, pointers to cpu/syetem/whatever object, etc.).
Slides & video from the tutorial are toward the bottom of the
m5sim.org web page, under "documentation".
