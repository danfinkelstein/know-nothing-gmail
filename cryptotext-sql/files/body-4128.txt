Richard,No, as a matter of fact it is not.  If you can, try applu or apsi -- those worked for me.I had two different failure types:  benchmarks where I couldn't even get a valid checkpoint, and benchmarks that failed after restoring the checkpoint and beginning simulation.  Ammp is in the latter category.  I'm using Simpoints' early simulation points to do this, so I'm sometimes fast-forwarding quite a ways before taking a checkpoint.  For the ones that failed after restoring, I don't think they always failed right away - some executed for many cycles after restoring before they failed (this was a while ago, though, so I don't remember for sure).  I think they almost all have the same error message, though -- some sort of page table issue.
If I get some time, I'll try and re-create some of the problems and see if they still occur, and if I can debug them.  It sure would be nice to get these running.   -Vilas- Show quoted text -

Is ammp among those you got to work? I only ask because this is the one I am trying to get work first.-R

But I've definitely gotten the checkpoints to work in SE mode, at least in 2.0b2.  The code may have changed for 2.0b3, but one of the developers will have to answer that.   -Vilas

Hi,
I am trying to get checkpoints working with ALPHA_SE and have run into
some problems. When I try to resume a checkpoint I get a fatal message
in src/mem/page_table.cc:110 fatal("PageTable::allocate: address 0x%x already mapped", vaddr);. It
appears that an address has already been mapped in the page table  Why
would this happen? Has anyone at least tried making checkpoint for a
spec2000 benchmark and resuming it for ALPHA_SE? Perhaps I am running code at the start of the binary after I restore the checkpoint?
-Richard
I make a checkpoint using:
./build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug  configs/example/se.py  --max_checkpoints=2 
--take_checkpoints="10000,100"  --checkpoint_dir=./checkpoints
I then try to resume a checkpoint with a AtomicSimpleCPU by the command:
$m5-2.0b3*11:57:44=>./build/ALPHA_SE/m5.debug  configs/example/se.py  -r 1 --checkpoint_dir=./checkpoints
