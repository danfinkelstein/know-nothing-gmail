It seems to work well with the "hello test". However, when I use a program such as one of the spec benchmark, I have the following output:

Have you applied patch 1 from the web site?  This looks like the bug that that fixes.
In addition, even when I use the hello test and I try to play with the coherence protocol, I got an error. I tried to set the coherence protocol in class  L1 as follows:
protocol = CoherenceProtocol(protocol='mesi')
This is what I got:
File "build/ALPHA_SE/python/m5/config.py", line 846, in __getattr__
  File "build/ALPHA_SE/python/m5/config.py", line 846, in __getattr__

  File "build/ALPHA_SE/python/m5/config.py", line 842, in __getattr__
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in cmp
Error setting param L1.protocol to root
It seems to me that the coherence protocol should be initialized in the cache, right ?
This is an m5 bug... the CoherenceProtocol object definition isn't getting loaded when you import m5.objects.  Here's the (trivial) patch:

Unfortunately MP coherence isn't quite working in 2.0beta1, so you're going to be limited to multiprogrammed workloads in the short term (i.e. setting the coherence protocol won't matter).  We're hoping to get that taken care of very soon, like in the next week or so.
