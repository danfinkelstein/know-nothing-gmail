Hi Ali thanks for your answer,I am using the fs.py that comes with the simulator, when I do the simulation with the atomic model works fine, but when I put the --detailed options then I get the error that I said before, this is the command that I use
./build/ALPHA_FS/m5.opt  -d /temp/output configs/example/fs.py -b Hello --detailed  --cachesThis is my rcS file.---- rcS file#!/bin/sh/benchmarks/Hellom5 exitThis is the output of the file system.terminal 
---- system.terminal fileBrought up 1 CPUsSMP: Total of 1 processors activated (4002.20 BogoMIPS).NET: Registered protocol family 16EISA bus registeredTo run the simulation what I have done is change the benchmarks.py file and I have added my own benchmark:
 'Hello':     [SysConfig('Hello.rcS')],In the file config.ini everything seems fine, any ideas about what is happening?. This error happens with every program that I try. If you need more information please tell me. Thanks so much.- Show quoted text -
