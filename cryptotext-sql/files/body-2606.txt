src/arch/alpha/tlb.hh. It would be great if you could make this work for all
ISAs instead of just alpha. To get the tlb definition for whatever the current
ISA is, include src/arch/tlb.hh. Instead of referring to it as AlphaISA::DTB,
use TheISA::DTB. The one complication might be that the properties of all the
ISA's TLBs aren't necessarily uniform, but that hopefully wouldn't be too hard
to deal with.
