That really makes sense. It helped me to understand things better.
It even made me able to fix the double delete-bug ;-).Â 
Can I send it to you? I'm not sure if sending patches along the users
mailing list is a proper habit =).yea, if you have patches then send out to the m5-dev list for "patch-review" so to speak.the preferred method is mercurial patchbomb extension (I believe), but even in the event your not 
using mercurial patchqueues, we're grateful for any patches that we can receive thatwill improve the code.Send away (to m5-dev)! -- - Korey
