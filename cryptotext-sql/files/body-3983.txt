As Steve said, M5 provides point-to-point link, but switch
model is needed to hook up more than two systems. So my
question is: Can I have several systems(> 2) work together
with each two having a distinct point-to-point link for data
transfer? It is somehow like a fully-connected network. In this
way, is switch model still needed? Thanks.
You can do this up to a point.  There is a limit for how many NICs you can attach due to the way interrupts work in the simulated system.  How big of a network do you want to build?
Also, a switch model wouldn't be that hard to do.- Show quoted text -
