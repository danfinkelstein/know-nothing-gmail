Hi,
I’m using the precompiled Splash benchmarks for M5 version 1.1 and the SE mode. The problem is that many of these benchmarks eventually deadlock. I have traced the problem to the synchronization functions in alpha_tru64_process.cc. Here, all processors end up calling the m5_cond_waitFunc() method and they all suspend. The really bad thing is that if you simulate for a fixed number of clock cycles, it is very difficult to see that something has gone wrong.
I’ve added the following code to the end of the m5_cond_waitFunc() method to detect the problem:
if(process->waitList.size() == process->numCpus()){
fatal("We have a deadlock");
}
Have you seen this problem before?
I think it might be a problem with the thread library. However, I have not been able to look into this as I do not have a working cross compiler. Have you been able to build a cross compiler for the Splash benchmarks and the thread libraries?
Regards,
Magnus Jahre
