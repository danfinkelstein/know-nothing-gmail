I'm not completely sure, but each packet has an opaque pointer that it
sends along with the packet that must be restored before the response
is send back to the host. In the case of a store for the o3 cpu, this
pointer contains information about the instruction, slot in the store
queue, etc. If the pointer was trashed or not properly restored, you
would likely see this error.
