Look in
build/SPARC_SE/tests/debug/long/00.gzip/sparc/linux/o3-timing/stdout
and
build/SPARC_SE/tests/debug/long/00.gzip/sparc/linux/o3-timing/stderr
for the output of the run. I'm guessing you either don't have the
executables it's trying to simulate, the inputs they require, or some
combination of those aren't in any place M5 was told to look.
I believe either the executables, inputs, or both are considered part
of SPEC (minnespec?) and you'll need to have a license to get them.
The hello world regressions don't have those restrictions and should
let you know to the first order whether everything's working.
