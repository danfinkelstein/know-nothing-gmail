Hello,
    Has anyone gotten to run simpoint execution with multiple workloads
in SE mode. I have looked at the asplos tutorial and some threads which
discussed this problem before. Single workloads simpoints are running
fine but with  say 2 workloads, it segfaults: (i am running the spec2k6
workloads in SE mode, assigning a different workload to each processor)
gcc.simpoint = 1e6
astar.simpoint = 2e6

If I use m5.opt, i get the following error:

Could anyone help with this?
Thanks,
