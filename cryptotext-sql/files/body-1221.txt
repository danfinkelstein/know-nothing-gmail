I am having difficulty tracing the assertion failure in mshr.hh: hasTargets(). While the casue is clear that mshr dont have any more targets but it is happening in the following loop:
while (mshr->hasTargets()) {
        MSHR::Target *target = mshr->getTarget();
        .....
        .....
}
Target *getTarget() { assert(hasTargets());  return &targets->front(); }
Is it possible the mshr data structure is being worked upon in a distributed manner (by different caches) causing the asertion failure?
