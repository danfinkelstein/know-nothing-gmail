I was actually thinking about this on and off...
First off, I totally agree with Nate. It wiill take a pretty big code
overhaul to get the CPUs to be ISA dependent.
Second, the ways I thought it might work is:
(1) Somehow link 2 M5 binaries and have them interface through the
same EventQueue. I'm not sure how ISA independent devices/memory are
though so another opinion would be needed to flesh out the feasibility
of that idea.
(2) Turn the "TheISA" namespace into an object. A overly conservative
way to do it would be to capture all of the ISA information into say
an "AlphaISA" class containing literally everything in the
src/arch/alpha/* folder (regfiles, process objects, etc.). Then, you
could just pass the ISA into the CPU model and wherever you see a
TheISA::func() you can turn it into a theISA->func(). Mind you, that
would be a not-so efficient way to do things but on a first cut that
is what makes sense to me if you want to start making ISA objects
portable instead of hard-coded in.
Again, not-so-easy to do and definitely a good chunk of time/effort.
