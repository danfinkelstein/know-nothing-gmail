It should work, although I generally use the checkpoint, restore,
switch method when sampling. There might be a problem with fast-
forwarding with multiple cpus. You should take a look at Simulation.py
and see what happens after the atomic cpu exits. All the atompc cpus
should be replaced with timing or detailed cpus and the atomic cpus
should be deactivated. Are you sure you're specifying a different type
of CPU after the switch?
