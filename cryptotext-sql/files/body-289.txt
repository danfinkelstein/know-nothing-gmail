Hi,
I am trying to port ssh to m5.
There are two related questions I have encountered:
1 When I tried to use the included benchmark SurgeSpecweb in the linux
image downloaded from m5sim.org,
I got the following error,
mounting swap...modprobe: FATAL: Could not load
/lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No such file or directory
modprobe: FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/2.6.13/modules.dep: No
such file or directory
But when I use NetPerf benchmark, there is no such error.
I figured that NetPerf is probably statically linked in.
2 Initially I got bunch of modprobe error similar to the above message.
So I compiled and linked ssh statically.
But I got the following error, not sure what it means here with
respect to the simulator.
I simply invoked sshd as /opt/sbin/sshd in the rcS script.
"starting sshd.../tmp/script: line 43: /opt/sbin/sshd: Input/output error"
Could you point me to the right direction of what is the good and
easier way to port ssh to m5?
Thanks for your help in advance.
john
