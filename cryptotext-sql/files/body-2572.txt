Hi Folks,
While trying to build m5.prof Alpha_SE I came across the following error:
build/ALPHA_SE/enums/Enum.cc:5: internal compiler error: in
tree_low_cst, at tree.c:3313
I am using gcc version 3.4.3
A quick google search revealed that this might be a bug in g++
Have you guys found a solution to this? Do higher version of gcc solve
the problem?
btw the same error occurred when I tried several different
combinations of MIPS/ALPHA FS/SE
Thanks
Z
