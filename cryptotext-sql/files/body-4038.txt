Sorry if I wasn't clear. I am using a name. I declared it like:
energy_access
       .name(name() + ".energy_access")
       .desc("Cumulative Energy if always ON")
       ;
energy_access = <name of static variable>.;
in the dram.cc file.
its declared as:
Stats::Formula energy_access;
in the dram.hh file.
I declared a static global variable in the dram.cc file, and update it in the calculateLatency() function. If I put a printf there, it prints out the values of the static variable correctly, as it changes. Problem is, there are so many memory accesses that printing out so many values into a file makes the file huge. And all I need is the final value at the end of simulations.
What I am trying to do is:
I want to calculate the energy spent in memory accesses (or in idle states), given that the memory bank is in some state. This can be calculated roughly as:
energy_access = idle_time * power(state)
which, here translates to:
energy_access = time_since_last_Access * power(state) / 1Thz,   (since the time_since_last_access is in units of 'ticks')
I will put some if--then conditions to calculate it differently depending on state, so I can't use just the integer value of total "time_since_last_access", and do multiplication later.
I dont know a way to calculate this without using float.
Can you suggest some way of doing this?
thanks,
- Sujay

Subject: Re: [m5-users] Float in stats- Show quoted text -
First, please keep your questions to the list and not to me directly for everyone else's benefit.
Another follow up to my previous mail:
I tried using a static variable (float), doing all calculations with it. Now I want to dump the value of this at the end, so I tried assigning it to oa Formula stat so that it is printed out at the end.
Stats:: Formula energy;
in the regStats,
energy = static_variable;
Problem is this stat is not being printed at all. Any ideas?
If you don't at least give a stat a name (using the .name() function), it won't print.
