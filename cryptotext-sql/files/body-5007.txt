I fear the general answer is going to be "because I didn't and
still don't know much about Python" but here goes...

So did I but without it I got errors.

Yup, that would seem like a good idea (in hindsight). It was actually
generated by a big regexp from a similar config file of mine for another
simulator which didn't support classes.

I chose to copy the files because that works best on the cluster of
machines I'm using to run my simulations and it's also what the official
runspec script does which is why I can take the command lines from the
website and use them pretty much verbatim. Some of the benchmarks have
implicit assumptions about where to find files relative to the cwd, so
if one were to just use a single shared directory then you could end up
with multiple output files clobbering each other.
Hope this helps somewhat,
