As I recall there was some known reason why it wouldn't work - I remember us saying at a tutorial that "in theory" you could do something SMARTS-like but that we didn't have the capability to return back to an old cpu yet.  I don't remember what the reason was, I was assuming Kevin would remember....Kevin?

As far as I know there's no reason why switching back to the original
CPU shouldn't work.  If it's not working I'd say that's a bug.  If the
symptom is that nothing happens, it sounds like the tick events on the
CPUs aren't getting scheduled, or maybe the thread context is not
properly transitioning to the active state.  The first thing I'd check
is what state the thread context of an old CPU is left in after you do
a takeOverFrom() on it... if that's not the same state as a newly
created idle CPU then that's probably at least part of the problem.
