Hi Nathan,
Using that code, would it be possible to use x86 simulation in full-system mode, or just in syscall emulation mode? Do you have any time estimate as to when the parallel version will be available?

I'm sorry, maybe my e-mail was confusing.  Nothing that we've released so
far has had any license problems with HP.  There is a considerable amount of
code that I have outstanding that is not in the M5 tree at all that fixes
various problems and begins the process of parallelizing the simulator.  The
big thing is that we have a significant start at x86 support thanks to
Gabe.  This code is in the M5 internal tree, but owned by HP.  Now that we
have a proper license from HP for that code, there are no licensing problems
with anything in our source tree, and as soon as we have the actual proper
license text added to all files, we will be able to make all of these
unreleased changes and the source repository itself public.
Is that clearer?

Which specific parts are owned by HP? Anything to do with their
ownership of Alpha?

Hello everyone,
I just got some great news, and I wanted to pass it on to those who may
be
following M5 development.
HP has agreed to release infrastructure changes to M5 under a BSD
license.
In addition, I will be allowed to release all of the x86 ISA code that
we
have developed so far under a non-commercial license.  I'm not sure
exactly
what the mechanism of the release will be like (hopefully we'll make it
transparent and not a separate repository/download), but I have to work
out
the details with HP lawyers.
I'd like to also let everyone know that now that we are able to release
HP's
code, we will be able to clear up all of the license issues in our
source
repository and make the repository available to all users.  We use a
distributed revision control tool called mercurial to manage our
repository
and we will allow public read access to this repository.  This will
likely
mean that we will change from our periodic release model to a model
where we
request that most people track our development more closely since it
will be
so much easier to follow our changes more closely.
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.  There are some
details
of the release of all of this code that we will have to work out over
the
next two weeks, but we will try to get it all sorted out as soon as
possible.
We'll post more information about the new changes with a detailed list
as
soon as we can.
