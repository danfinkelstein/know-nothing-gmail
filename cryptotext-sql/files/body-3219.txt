But the mcf, lucas, facerec, etc. all work without these 
changes too. The benchmarks/cpu2000/data/mcf/input actually contains mcf.in 
file, and it does run with this.

  Here's an attempt at a diff.  I say 'attempt' because (a) I have 
  some local modifications to the cpu2000.py file, and (b) I haven't tested this 
  since I'm working around these problems a different way.  I generated 
  this diff using an unmodified version of cpu2000.py, though, and it looks 
  okay, so hopefully it should apply cleanly.
