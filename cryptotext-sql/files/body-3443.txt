> For a multiple core system in m5 with shared bus , consider two writes issued by two different cores at the same time. What is the criteria as to which one will be granted access first? What memory consistency model m5 implements? And which are the associated files to understand it?
Since nobody has answered this question yet, I will give it a shot.
Basically, we currently implement weak consistency and require that
fences or barriers be inserted in code to guarantee order.  This is
mostly because we started with Alpha as a model.  That said, Sparc and
x86 have stronger guarantees, but I don't believe that we currently
implement them.  As for which files, that's really hard to say since
it doesn't really exist.  If you were to implement sequential
consistency, you'd probably have to do it in the lsq and the
storebuffer and the memory dependence unit stuff, but I'm not sure
that that would be it.  The fence instructions accomplish their goal
by serializing the pipeline. You can search for the sMemBarrier and
isWriteBarrier instruction flags.
If this doesn't give you enough information, let us know and maybe
steve or kevin can answer better.
