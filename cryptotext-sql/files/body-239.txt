Hi all,
I have some questions on understanding M5 stats for shared L2 cache.
1) In our simulations, "system.l2.Writeback_accesses" is always  = "system.l2.Writeback_hits". But the trace shows there're L2 Writeback misses. Why there's no L2 Writeback misses in stats.txt?
2) In stats.txt, there is another parameter called "system.l2.writebacks", how is it related to the "system.l2.Writeback_accesses"?
3) I noticed that, "system.l2.overall_accesses" is always = "system.l2.ReadExReq_accesses" + "system.l2.ReadReq_accesses::total", and "system.l2.ReadExReq_accesses" always = "system.l2.ReadExReq_misses", why is that? If ReadReq_accesses are always missed, why bother to have two parameters?
4) The memory trace for my simulations are very large (around 10GB for a simulation). I commented most DPRINTF functions and only leave hits and misses, but it is still too large for me. Does anybody have this problem before? And is there a way in M5 to sample the trace by setting a time interval?
Thanks,
Jie
