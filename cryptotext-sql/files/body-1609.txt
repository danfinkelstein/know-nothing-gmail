I want to record the trace the access to disk. During every access, I
hope M5 to display the data which is accessed. For example, if an read
access to disk, I want to know the data that would be read. For an write
access, the data before and after writing are wanted. Does M5 support
such operations? If not, can I make some modifications based on M5?
Thanks in advance.
