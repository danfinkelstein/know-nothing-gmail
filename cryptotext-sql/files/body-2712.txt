I downloaded the encumbered files and used the extras command as given on
the page. It passes 1 test but gives an error in the second as follows:
build/ALPHA_SE/m5.fast -d
build/ALPHA_SE/tests/fast/quick/20.eio-short/alpha/eio/simple-atomic
tests/run.py quick/20.eio-short/alpha/eio/simple-atomic >
build/ALPHA_SE/tests/fast/quick/20.eio-short/alpha/eio/simple-atomic/stdout

build/ALPHA_SE/tests/fast/quick/20.eio-short/alpha/eio/simple-atomic/stderr
scons: ***

the stderr contains:

There is no directory called 'anagram' in tests/test-progs. Do I have to
download additional files?
Thanks,
Sujay
