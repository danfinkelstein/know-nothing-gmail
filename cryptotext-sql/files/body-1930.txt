I believe that they should work in both.  Anyone else know differently?
Are you doing this from a checkpoint or from boot?  If you're doing it
from boot, that's probably nowhere near enough.

A mode like this has been requested many times, but as far as we can
tell, this leads to a bogus methodology, so we don't have it.
The problem is that to do this, you'd have to stop CPUs which would
throw off what is going on.
I think the best alternative is to dump statistics each time a CPU
hits the cycle count, and then you can compare the statistics dumps
for each cpu separately.  This way, you're at least maintaining the
steady state and not experiencing cool down effects like the thing
above would suffer.
