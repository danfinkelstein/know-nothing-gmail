Hi Nate, Ali,I'm doing AVF calculations, and I'd like to account for the edge effect at the end of simulation by draining currently 'live' objects from my structures before computing the final statistics.  I just added some registerExitCallback() calls and it seems to work, although I haven't had time to test it extensively yet.
What's the difference between this and registerResetCallback?  At a quick glance, it looks like registerResetCallback is called every time reset() is called (more than once per simulation), while registerExitCallback() is called just once at the end of simulation.  Are there other more subtle differences?  Is registerResetCallback called at the end of simulation?
Practically speaking, I think registerExitCallback will do what I need as long as it's called before the final stats are printed out (and it seems to be -- I update some stats in that function), although it may not work in more complicated situations (switching out CPU models and so on).  But at least for me, this seems to be fine.

be easy enough to add a registerDumpCallbakc that would occur when dump iscalled.   Nate_______________________________________________m5-users mailing listm5-users@m5sim.org
