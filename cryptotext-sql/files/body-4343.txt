Hi Jonas,
Previously the problem with allowing public access to our repository was that we were using a proprietary revision control system. We recently migrated to Mercurial (http://www.selenic.com/mercurial) and plan to allow public read access very soon.  Our hope is that this will accelerate the M5 development process giving those who want it the bleeding edge and allowing people to easily contribute by e-mailing patches from their repository directly.

Hi,
I just ran into the same problem that Jiayuan ran into a few weeks ago
(http://www.mail-archive.com/m5-users@m5sim.org/msg01121.html) - a bug that
had already been fixed in the internal tree.
It seems that it is happening quite frequently that people see bugs which are
already fixed in the internal tree (just search for "our tree" in the ML
archives). I was wondering if there is any way that you could allow public
access to your latest tree (maybe via a public SVN read access), to reduce
these kinds of problems.
Of course I'd also understand that there might be reasons for you not wanting
people to see/use your bleeding edge tree (unfinished/not working code etc.),
but I thought I'd just ask :-).
Best regards
Jonas
