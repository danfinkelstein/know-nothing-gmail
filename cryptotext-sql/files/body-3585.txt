Hi Allan,
Since nobody answered, it seems that nobody has anything they want to
give you.  I'm pretty sure people have done this sort of thing in the
past.  I'm quite certain that it can be done now.  Unfortunately you
can never apply the word "easy" or any of its derivative forms to
directory coherence, but I will say that there are many positive
aspects of M5's design that might make it less hard.  The primary
thing being the port interface and the way memory objects can
communicate with each other.  If you do decide to give it a shot, feel
free to ask questions on the list.  Many of us know quite a bit about
these sorts of things.  I will ask that you be specific and detailed
though.  You're much more likely to receive a response on this sort of
stuff if you've done your homework and ask a thoughtful question.
