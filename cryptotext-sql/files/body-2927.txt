For some benchmarks, it even happen after applying patches though most benchmarks work. I send Steve binary and script files for one case for which it happens so he maybe working on that. For one benchmark, the problem disappears after I increased the MSHR queue size for L3 cache. I never dig myself deeper into debugging the execution traces but I do believe there is a problem. Also, I had this problem for some media benchmarks, I guess epic and gsm, while others (jpeg,mpeg etc) worked fine.
