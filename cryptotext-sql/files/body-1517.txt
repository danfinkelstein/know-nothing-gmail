What is the address you're using in the broadcast packet? Broadcast
doesn't really mean broadcast as much as it means you figure out where
to send the data. In the case of a shared bus in reality this would
mean a broadcast, but to make the simulation run more quickly instead
it means look up in a table of all the addresses you have and see
which one will respond to this address. If you want different behavior
than this, you'll probably need to add a different flag to the packet.
