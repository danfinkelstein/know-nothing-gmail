Thank you very much for your response, Steve.
One more quick clarification:
You response to my first question seems to suggest that the current
infrastructure supports SMT on SE mode for SPARC and/or ALPHA as long
as I limit the number of s/w threads to the number of h/w threads? Is
that correct?
regards,
Soumyaroop.
