Yes, you can set the max_insts_any_thread or max_insts_all_threads
params on a CPU object and the simulation will exit once any (or all)
threads on that CPU have executed that many instructions.

I don't see a command-line param for it, but you could roll your own
by setting up a loop in your simulation script where you call
m5.simulate(interval) and then m5.stats.dump() and then repeat.  You
can look in configs/common/Simulation.py to see something similar in
the code that dumps checkpoints at regular intervals.
