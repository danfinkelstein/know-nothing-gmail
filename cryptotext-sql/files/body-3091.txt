If you can't run a virtual machine of any kind, then the only option I know of is to use cygwin.  M5 should compile under cygwin and I believe it runs ok in SE mode, but FS mode is iffy because it relies on signals which aren't implemented correctly in cygwin (though I think this could be worked around).
