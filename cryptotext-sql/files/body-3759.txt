Hi m5 developers --Just a quick question: do you happen to know whether another release of m5 will be forthcoming in the near future?  I'm using v2.0b2, and I have made a number of modifications that it will take me a while to port to a new release.  If there's another release imminent (
i.e. within the next month), I will wait, but otherwise I'll port over to using v2.0b4.Thanks,    -Vilas
