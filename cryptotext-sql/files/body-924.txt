You need to set the profile parameter on the CPU object.  This will
dump a profile into the output directory.  You then use
util/stats/profile.py to parse the file.  There isn't really any
documentation on how this works, so you're just going to have to read
the source code.  I also haven't used this in over a year, so I don't
recall how stable it is.
