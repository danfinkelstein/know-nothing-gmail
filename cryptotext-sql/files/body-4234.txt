Hi，all
       
      I am trying to use spec2000 in FS mode. I found from m5 index that cpu2000.py can be used to do it. 
When I put the compiled benchmarks in the disk-img, and specify directory in cpu2000.py,  workload 
containing the benchmark should be defined according to M5 documentation. However I notice that the 
concept of workload is only used in se.py, it doesn’t appear in fs.py. 
     
      Should I change fs.py or cpu2000.py to run benchmark in FS mode? Can cpu2000.py be used
 in FS mode? Could anybody tell me how to change it in order that I can use it in FS mode? I will appreciate
 very much if someone give me some detail examples.
