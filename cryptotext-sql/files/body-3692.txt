M5 simulates the network at the Ethernet layer, so any protocol
supported by Linux will work (udp/ip, tcp/ip, icmp, ...).
You could generate artificial cpu loads under m5 just as you would on
a real machine (by running a dummy program that eats cpu cycles).
That would chew up a lot of simulation time though.  A more efficient
approach that might be useful (depending on what you're studying)
would just be to slow the cpu down by running it at a lower frequency.
