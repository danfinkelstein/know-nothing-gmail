It appears as though the O3 cpu never initializes its thread status to ThreadContext::Unallocated unlike the simple CPUs which do. This normally wouldn't be a problem because very rarely to people start executing with a detailed CPU. Normally a simple CPU is used to fast-forward to a point of interest. Anyway, fixing it should be as easy as inserting thread->setStatus(ThreadContext::Unallocated) into the O3 CPU constructor.

Subject: Re: [m5-users] detailed CPU error
It means that the application tried to create a thread but there
wasn't an idle hardware thread context (e.g. a free CPU) to run it on.
If it works with SimpleCPU I'm not sure why it would fail with O3 though.

Hello,
      When I try to execute splash2 bemchmarks in SE mode, I get the
following error if I use the -d (detailed CPU switch)
nxm_thread_create: no idle contexts available.
Program aborted at cycle 281737000
What does this mean?
The timing or atomic CPU runs fine.
