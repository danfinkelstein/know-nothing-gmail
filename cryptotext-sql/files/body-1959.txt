Dear all:
  Thanks for all responses to help me to run SpecOMP on M5. Does
somebody have another linux dump file instead of the one provided in
M5 site? The linux dump in M5 site have no utility. Does somebody can
provide a linux dump file with gcc/gdb? Maybe I can build the
benchmark in the simulator or using gdb to know why I always get
segmentation fault when I run the binaries.
regards,
  sitos
