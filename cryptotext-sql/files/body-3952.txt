        Since this seems like an easy mistake to make (I think even the example
or regression scripts were wrong in this way at one point) it might make
sense to put in a check like:
if isInstance(cmd, string):
   # Die horrible death
This is probably my fault.  I can't remember exactly what was going on, but I did it to fix a real bug.  The reason you want it as an array is that because you do sometimes want an argument that has a space in it. Take the following shell example
   sh -c echo foo
and
   sh -c "echo foo"
The former would be [ 'sh', '-c', 'echo', 'foo' ] and the latter would be
[ 'sh', '-c', 'echo foo' ].  If you try this at the shell prompt, you'll see that you do indeed get two different results.
I could potentially do more magic to try to do what the shell does and accept a string, but I'm not that motivated right now.  If someone wants to write that code, I'll happily integrate it.  (Probably create a new param type in params.py.)
As for the error message, that's probable a good idea.
