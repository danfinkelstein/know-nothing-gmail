Hi, everyone,I have question about a code block of the function  "bool  Cache<TagStore>::access(PacketPtr pkt, BlkType *&blk, int &lat, PacketList &writebacks)" in the file "src/mem/cache/cache_impl.hh". The following is the code block to be ased about.
if (blk == NULL && pkt->isLLSC() && pkt->isWrite()) {       // complete miss on store conditional... just give up now       pkt->req->setExtraData(0);       return true;}
Although there is a sentence of comments there, the meaning of the code block is still not clear to me at all. What is the significance of the code block? What is it used for? Since "blk" is NULL, why is a "true" still returned finally?
Any help would be greatly appreciated!Thanks,Leonard-- Give our ability to our work, but our genius to our life!
