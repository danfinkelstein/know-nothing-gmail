Those errors can be ignored.  I can't remember exactly what they were,
but apache is basically trying to see if the kernel supports something
(like ipv6) and modprobe for the module fails.

This isn't the issue.

Not sure what exactly the problem is, but my guess is that it's a
filesystem problem or some problem with the sshd binary.  Where did
you get the binary from?

You want to use crosstools to build a crosscompiler toolchain and then
use that to build sshd.  Alternatively, you can try to use a gentoo
stage3 tarball to populate a disk image.
