Steve,
I'd be interested in working on an implementation of TM for M5.
I'm currently working on trying to thread an H264 decoder, and I eventually
want to see if TM would work well for it compared to other methods like
pthreads, MPI etc.

Subject: [m5-users] Transactional memory in m5?
Anyone else interested in some sort of a (basic) transactional memory
implementation within M5?
I am, and I'm just querying to see if anyone else working on/with M5
would be interested, and perhaps interested in collaborating. If so,
please let me know.
Thanks,
Steve Lieberman
