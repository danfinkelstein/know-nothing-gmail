I agree that this is a great idea. Perhaps this is something you could ask ASPLOS organizers (the steering committee).

By the way, I read that someone requested for this tutorial to be recorded.
Are there any plans for this? This will be very helpful for us (me and my
colleagues who plan to use m5) since we cannot go to ASPLOS for a variety of
reasons (primarily and frankly, difficulty for applying for a US visa coming
from a third world country and the cost of going to Seattle, probably equal
to at least six months of what we get for a round trip).

I just wanted to remind everyone about the tutorial at ASPLOS. We're
about two weeks away now.
Thanks,

I just wanted to make everyone aware that we're holding a tutorial
again at ASPLOS this year (Sunday 3/2) in the morning. We're
planning to provide public access to the M5 repository in
conjunction with the tutorial.
We have some exciting new features in v2.0, including:
- New cache model
- More abstract cache coherence that is general enough to allow
multi-level configurations
- Inter-object protocol for memory-system objects
- Python creation of object parameters
- Support for ARM, SPARC, and MIPS
- Performance improvements
- Creating and using Simpoints
Even if you came to last year's tutorial, you can come again to
learn about these new features.
We'll also be discussing:
- M5 structure
- Specifying configurations
- Running experiments
- Statistics
- Debugging techniques
- Future development directions
So, if you're new to M5, you're going to learn enough to get started.
Our tutorial page:
http://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/ASPLOS_2008
ASPLOS web page (registration, schedule, etc.):
http://research.microsoft.com/asplos08/
Hope to see you there!
Ali
